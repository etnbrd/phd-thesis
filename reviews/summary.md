#Gaël Thomas

- The introduction is a bit short : it lacks the main results.
- The chapter 4 lacks a discussion about dynamic analysis. It is anly discussed in conclusion.
- In chapter 5, the reviewer expected some result to show the performance impact yielded by the transformations on a *sequential* execution.
- And explanations on why it is difficult to conduct the same experiment on a *parallel* execution (because the transformation are not ready)

#Frédéric Loulergue

- The chapter 3 lacks some parallelism models, especially in the case of high-performance computing.
