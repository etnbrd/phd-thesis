\chapter{Javascript}

Javascript was created by Brendan Eich in 10 days in May 1995.
It was designed as a script for web pages.
The language was taken in 1996 by the ECMA association under the name ECMAScript, and referenced by the specification ECMA-262.


\section{The evolution of Javascript}

Javascript started as scripting language for web pages.
But extended past this initial usage.
It is now used in very different ways from embedded systems to desktop applications.



The Atom editor is written in Javascript node.js.



Now, major PaaS (which one) support node.js by default.

Heroku support Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Clojure and Scala

Amazon Lambda Web service support node.js in priority.

>>> News :

npm raises 8m.
http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/14/popular-javascript-package-manager-npm-raises-8m-launches-private-modules/

% >>> I want to say that Javascript is now broadly used.
% Let's just look at the numbers : Javascript is the most popular language on Github, and npm has more package than any other package manager.
% Javascript has the more broadly deployed runtime.
% ... and so on
% >>> the conclusion is : Javascript is now a major language, and it is more than worth the consideration we are giving it in this PhD thesis.


\section{Asynchronous programming}

Web pages are graphical environment offering multiple area of interaction for the user.
Because of this multiplicity, the traditional linear programing model doesn't hold anymore.
Graphical systems switched from this linear programming model to a different programming model focused on events.

Javascript uses higher-order functions.
It is the ability for a language to manipulate functions like any other value.
This ability is used to register a function to trigger after an event occurred.
An event might be the click on an element of the page, for example.

Such a function is named a callback, a handler, a listener ...
And it shift the programming paradigm from synchronous to asynchronous, which is a big deal.

In synchronous programming, the computation step are executed sequentially, one after the other.
The program execution follows perfectly the program layout written in a linear textual file.

On the other hand, asynchronous programming allows a step back from this linearity.


A multi-threaded system allows the developer to explicitly express the parallelism in the application.
A GOTO statement allows the developer to explicitly express the control flow in the application.


Asynchronous programming allows the program to manage the concurrency of the execution.
Unlike a linear layout of an imperative program, it allows to express more finely the dependencies between instructions.



% James Coglan speak about Promises and the abstraction they allow on the control flow. much interesting, especially at the end.

% >>> I want to say that Javascript is the first language broadly used with this asynchronous paradigm.
% Is asynchronous programming a step before declarative programming ?

A closure is a function associated with the environment in which it was declared.
It is used in languages with higher-order functions, such as Javascript, to have lexical scoping.
