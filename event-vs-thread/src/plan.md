# Javascript landscape

1. At its beginning, Javascript remains almost unnoticed.
It was an awkward language to develop small animations in the browser
At the time, the interface for real application in the browser were developed with Java applets.
I think this quietude allowed the language to slowly, but firmly, settle in the browsers.
Indeed, the language was created in 10 days, but multiple specification were released the next few years.

Until 2005, with the creation of Ajax, which sparkled various open source projects and communities of users and developers (prototype, jquery).

2. Because of this, Javascript is developed from bottom-up and is adopted only later in professionals environment.
On the contrary of erlang and scala, for example, which were developed by and for professionals.
The rapid web expansion allow individuals to work faster, and adopts novelties faster than more conservative environment, like the industry.

4. JS is the web assembly language.
Today, it is the most popular language on github.
It is the language the most deployed (because each browser has a JS runtime).
It is isomorphic, it can be deployed on both the client and the server.
