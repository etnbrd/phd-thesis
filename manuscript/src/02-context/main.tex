\section{Introduction}

This chapter presents the general context for this work, and leads to a definition of the problematic addressed in this thesis.
Section \ref{chapter2:web-as-a-platform} presents the context for the web development, and the motivation that led the web to become a software platform. It presents briefly the main languages available for initiating a web application, and a great section is dedicated to Javascript, as it is increasingly gained popularity these past few years.
Section \ref{chapter2:highly-concurrent-web-servers} presents the problematic for developping web server for large audiences.
It explains why the languages presented in the previous section often fail to grow with the project they initially supported very efficiently.
It conclude that this rupture is an economical risk for young projects.
Finally, section \ref{chapter2:equivalence} presents the goal of this work.
That is to reconcile the technologies used in the initial phase of a project, with the ones used to grow the project in performance.
