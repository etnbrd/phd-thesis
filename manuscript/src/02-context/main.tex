The web allows applications to grow a user base very quickly.
The developement of a web application needs to follow this rapid pace to assure performance efficiency.
But the languages often fail to grow with the project they initially supported very efficiently.

The inadequacy of the languages to support the growth of web applications leads to wasted development efforts, and additional costs.
The objective of this thesis is to avoid these efforts and costs.
It intends to provide a continuous development from the initial prototype up to the releasing and maintenance of the complete product.

This chapter presents the general context for this work, and leads to a definition of the scope of this thesis.
Section \ref{chapter2:web-as-a-platform} presents the context of web development, and the motivations that led the web to become a software platform.
It presents Javascript as the trending language currently taking over web development.
Then, it presents the challenges of developing web servers for large audiences.
Section \ref{chapter2:problem-statement} states the problem tackled by this thesis, and its objectives.
