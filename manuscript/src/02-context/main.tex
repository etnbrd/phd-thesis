Section \ref{chapter2:web-as-a-platform} presents the context of web development, and the motivations that led the web to become a software platform.
It presents Javascript as the main language of the web available for prototyping.
Then, it presents the problematic of developing web server past this prototyping phase for large audiences.
% It concludes that this rupture is an economical risk.
Section \ref{chapter2:problem-statement} states the problem tackled by this thesis, and its objectives.
The languages often fail to grow with the project they initially supported very efficiently.
The inadequacy of the languages to support the growth of web applications leads to wasted development efforts, and additional costs.
The objective of this thesis is to avoid these efforts and costs.
It intends to propose a continuous development from the initial prototype up to the releasing and maintenance of the complete product.
