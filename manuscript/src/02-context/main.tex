This chapter presents the general context for this work, and leads to a definition of the scope of this thesis.
Section \ref{chapter2:web-as-a-platform} presents the context of web development, and the motivations that led the web to become a software platform.
It presents Javascript as the trending language currently taking over web development.
Then, it presents the problematic of developing web servers for large audiences past the prototyping phase.
Section \ref{chapter2:problem-statement} states the problem tackled by this thesis, and its objectives.
In the economical context of the Web, the languages often fail to grow with the project they initially supported very efficiently.
The inadequacy of the languages to support the growth of web applications leads to wasted development efforts, and additional costs.
The objective of this thesis is to avoid these efforts and costs.
It intends to provide a continuous development from the initial prototype up to the releasing and maintenance of the complete product.
