\section{Scalability}
  \subsection{Theories}
    \subsubsection{Linear Scalability}
    \subsubsection{Limited Scalability}
    \subsubsection{Negative Scalability}
      \comment{Conclusion : scalability = concurrency + not sharing the resources that grows with the scale}
  \subsection{Concurrency}
    \comment{Concurrency is time slicing or multi-threading)}
    % \subsubsection{Synchronization}
    %   \comment{when there is concurrency inside a same system (so the components are somewhat dependent on each others : causal relation, or state sharing), there is a need for synchronization}
    %   \paragraph{Lock}
    %   \paragraph{Events}
    %   \paragraph{\comment{TODO} others ?}
    \subsubsection{Time-slicing}
      \paragraph{Task management}
      \paragraph{Stack management}
    \subsubsection{Multi-Threading}
      \paragraph{Eventual Consistency}
      \paragraph{Event-based multi-threading}

  \subsection{Scalability outside computer science (only if I have time)}
      \comment{
        If I have time, I would like to try to explain why scalability is at the core of material engagement and information theory,
        and is at the core of our universe : the propagation of Gravity wave is an example : it is impossible to scale
        }
