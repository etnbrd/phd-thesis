\section{Objectives}

  \subsection{Problem : the pivot}

    \subsubsection{Development \& Performance Scalability}
      \comment{Where I explain the two (It should be clear from the two previous section), and why it is difficult to switch from one to the other.}

    \subsubsection{A difficult compromise}
      \comment{
        It is impossible to truely merge development and true linear performance scalability :
        linear performance scalability means perfect parallelism, that is impossible for multiple reasons.
        It is impossible to reduce the time of an operation infinitely : an instant computation doesn't exist.
        It is impossible to decompose a set of operation past a certain point : the coupling (sharing / causality) is needed for computation : this composition is the fabric of computation.
      }

  \subsection{Proposal and Hypothesis}

    \subsubsection{LiquidIT}
      \comment{TODO liquid IT is roughly about improving the compromise between development and performance scalability (it is more than that, and I need to explain it briefly, but I need to narrow the field to focus on my thesis)}
    \subsubsection{Pipeline parallelism for event-loop}
      \comment{The hypothesis is that it is possible for event-looped web applications to be pipeline parallelized, and so to be distributed}
    \subsubsection{Parallelization and distribution of web applications}
      \comment{the proposal is to study and develop a solution to parallelize and distribute web applications.}
