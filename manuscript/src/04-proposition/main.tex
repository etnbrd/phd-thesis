The conclusion of the state of the art is that no platform allows to follow a project from the early beginning to the maturation of the project.
Indeed, no platform can provide alternatively productivity and efficiency.
All the platform tends to focus on a static compromise between these two goals, and therefore, are useful only at a precise point in the project.
They either grow useless, or are too complicated to begin with.

This chapter presents the solution developped in this thesis.
A platform to follow web application projects from the early beginning until the maturation of the project.

To support this evolution, it support a continuous developpement.
