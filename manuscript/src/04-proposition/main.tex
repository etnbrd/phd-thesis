The evolution of the economical constraints of a web application requires to continuously shift from productivity to efficiency.
The incompatibility of platforms between the two organizations implies technological ruptures during this evolution.
Huge developing efforts are pulled to translate manually from one organization into the other, and later to maintain the implementation despites its unmaintainable nature.

In this chapter, section \ref{chapter4:equivalence} introduces the solution developed in this thesis.
A platform allowing to follow the development of a web application with a seamless shift of focus, from the productivity required in the early beginning until the efficiency required during maturation.
It is based on the transformation of an event-driven program to target a pipeline architecture.
Section \ref{chapter4:event-driven} presents the event-driven execution model on which relies the transformation.
And section \ref{chapter4:pipeline} presents the pipeline architecture targeted by the transformation.
