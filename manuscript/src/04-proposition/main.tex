The evolution of the economical constraints of a web application requires to continuously shift from productivity to efficiency.
The incompatibility between the two organizations forces platforms to propose a compromise between the two.
And it makes it impossible for these platforms to follow the evolution of a web application.
Hence, it implies technological ruptures during this evolution.
Huge developing efforts are pulled to translate manually from one organization into the other, and later to maintain the implementation. % despites its unmaintainable nature.

% This thesis introduces in section \ref{chapter4:proposition} a solution to follow this evolution.

% The proposition developed in this thesis is introduced in section \ref{chapter4:proposition}, and then developed throughout this chapter.

% It is based on the transformation of an event-driven program to target a pipeline architecture.
% The event-driven execution model on which relies the transformation is presented in section \ref{chapter4:event-driven}.
% Whereas the pipeline architecture targeted by the transformation, called the fluxional execution model, is presented section \ref{chapter4:flx-model}.
% Finally, the equivalence between the event-driven and the fluxional execution model is presented section \ref{chapter4:equivalence}.

\section{Conclusion}

This chapter presented the proposition of this thesis : an equivalence between the event-driven execution model and the pipeline execution model for web applications.
The equivalence intends to allows developers to control simultaneously productivity, and efficiency of their implementation.
Because it allows them to continuously have two representations, developers can then choose their compromize, depending on what they are after.
This compromize evolves with the implementation.

The equivalence is based on the event-driven and fluxional execution models presented respectively in section \ref{chapter4:event-driven} and \ref{chapter4:flx-model}.
It relies on the similar pipeline organization shared by these two models.
It detects the rupture points between the stages to extract the pipeline organization from an event-driven implementation.
Then, it isolates these stages so as to allow parallel execution.

We published this work at three occasions.
The core idea of these contribution was briefly presented as a poster in December 2014 at Middleware \cite{Brodu2014}, and then more thouroughly presented in April 2015 at Symposium for Application Computing in the track Practical Aspect of Parallel Programming \cite{Brodu2015a}.
In the meantime, an intermediate step was presented in April 2015, at the AWeS Workshop at the Eurosys Conference \cite{Brodu2015}.
The implementations presented in these papers are reminded in the next section.
