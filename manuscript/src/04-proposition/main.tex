The evolution of the economical constraints of a web application requires to continuously shift from productivity to efficiency.
The incompatibility between the two organizations implies technological ruptures during this evolution.
Huge developing efforts are pulled to translate manually from one organization into the other, and later to maintain the implementation despites its unmaintainable nature.

The proposition developed in this thesis is introduced in section \ref{chapter4:proposition}, and then developed throughout this chapter.

% It is based on the transformation of an event-driven program to target a pipeline architecture.
% The event-driven execution model on which relies the transformation is presented in section \ref{chapter4:event-driven}.
% Whereas the pipeline architecture targeted by the transformation, called the fluxional execution model, is presented section \ref{chapter4:flx-model}.
% Finally, the equivalence between the event-driven and the fluxional execution model is presented section \ref{chapter4:equivalence}.
