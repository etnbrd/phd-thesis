% \subsection{Due} \label{section:definitions:due}

A Due is an object used as placeholder for the eventual outcome of a deferred operation.
% Dues are a simplification of the Promise specification.
They are essentially similar to ECMAScript Promises\ftnt{http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/\#sec-promise-objects}, except for the convention to hand back outcomes.
% They leave the control over the conditional execution over the outcome to the developer.
They use the \textit{error-first} convention, like \textit{Node.js}, as illustrated line \ref{lst:due:error-first} in listing \ref{lst:due}.
The implementation of Dues and its tests are available online\ftnt{https://www.npmjs.com/package/due}.
A more in-depth description of Dues and their creation follows in the next paragraphs.
% The \texttt{mock} method is implemented in listing \ref{lst:due-creation}.
% While a promise expects two continuations, \texttt{onSuccess} and \texttt{onErrors}, the method \texttt{then} of a due expects only one continuation, following the convention \textit{error-first}.
% \footnotemark{\ref{ftn:error-conventions}}
% \footnotemark{\ref{ftn:error-first}}.

\begin{code}[js, %
             caption={Example of a due}, %
             label={lst:due}] %
var my_fn_due = require('due').mock(my_fn); //@\label{lst:due:mock}@

var due = my_fn_due(input);

due.then(function continuation(error, result) { //@\label{lst:due:error-first}@
  if (!error) {
    console.log(result);
  } else {
    throw error;
  }
});
\end{code}

A due is typically created inside the function which returns it.
In listing \ref{lst:due}, line \ref{lst:due:mock}, the \texttt{mock} method wraps the original function \texttt{my\_fn} in a Due-compatible function \texttt{mocked\_fn}.
The rest of this code is similar to the Promise example, listing \ref{lst:then}.

We illustrate in listing \ref{lst:due-creation} the creation of a Due.
The \texttt{mock} method, defined line \ref{lst:due-creation:new}, returns a Due compatible function.
That is a function that returns a Due, instead of expecting a continuation.

At its creation, line \ref{lst:due-creation:new}, the Due expects the original function as argument, which is \texttt{my\_fn} here.
The original function is executed immediatly at the call of the Due-compatible function \textit{mocked\_fn}.
The \texttt{settle} function passed as argument, line \ref{lst:due-creation:new}, is used as a continuation for the original function to settle the Due. %, synchronously or asynchronously.
Therefore, the \texttt{settle} function is pushed at the end of the list of arguments, line \ref{lst:due-creation:push}.
% Indeed, the operation might be synchronous, or asynchronous.
The callback invokes the deferred operation with this list of arguments, and the current context, line \ref{lst:due-creation:call}.
% \texttt{my\_fn} being asynchronous, it expects a callback as last argument : \texttt{settle}.
When finished, the latter calls \texttt{settle} to settle the Due and save the outcome.
% A Due is in one of two mutually exclusive states: settled or pending.
The created Due is returned synchronously.
Its \texttt{then} method allows to define a continuation to retrieve the saved outcome, and continue the execution after its settlement.
If the deferred operation is synchronous, the Due settles during its creation and the \texttt{then} method immediately calls this continuation.
If the deferred operation is asynchronous, this continuation is called during the Due settlement.

% This continuation is defined by the \texttt{then} method.
% After the settlement of the Due, its continuation is executed with the outcome.
% Dues expose a \texttt{then} method expecting a continuation to continue the execution after its settlement.

\begin{code}[js, %
             caption={Creation of a due}, %
             label={lst:due-creation}] %
Due.mock = function(my_fn) { //@\label{lst:due-creation:mock}@
  return function mocked_fn() { //@\label{lst:due-creation:mocked}@
    var _args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments),
        _this = this;

    return new Due(function(settle) {  //@\label{lst:due-creation:new}@
      _args.push(settle);  //@\label{lst:due-creation:push}@
      my_fn.apply(_this, _args); //@\label{lst:due-creation:call}@
    })
  }
}
\end{code}

The composition of Dues is the same than for Promises, as illsutrated in listing \ref{lst:dues-sequence}.% explained in section \ref{chapter4:event-loop:promise}.
% This composition is explained in details in section \ref{section:definitions:promise}. %, and illustrated specifically for Dues in listing \ref{lst:dues-sequence}.
Through this chained composition, Dues arrange the execution flow as a sequence of actions to carry on inputs.

\begin{code}[js, %
             caption={Dues are chained like Promises}, %
             label={lst:dues-sequence}] %
var Due = require('due');

var my_fn_due_1 = Due.mock(my_fn_1),
    my_fn_due_2 = Due.mock(my_fn_2),
    my_fn_due_3 = Due.mock(my_fn_3);

my_fn_1(input)
.then(my_fn_2)
.then(my_fn_3)
.then(console.log);
\end{code}

This simplified specification adopts the same convention than \textit{Node.js} for continuations to hand back outcomes.
Therefore, the equivalence between a continuation and a Due is trivial.
% This equivalence, and its composition are explained in details in section \ref{section:equivalence}.
Dues are admittedly tailored for this work, hence, they are not designed to be written by developers, like Promises are.
They are an intermediary step between classical continuations and the second step of the transformation, presented in chapter \ref{chapter6}.
The next section presents the equivalence between continuations and Dues.


% In listing \ref{lst:due}, \texttt{due} is settled when the function \texttt{settle} is called.
% If \texttt{due} is settled, a call to \texttt{due.then(onSettlement)} immediately call the function \texttt{onSettlement}.
% A due is pending if it is not settled.
% A due is resolved if it is settled or if it has been linked with another due.
% Attempting to settle a resolved due has no effect.
% A resolved due may be pending or settled, while an unresolved due is always in the pending state.
% The \texttt{Due} object only exposes the \texttt{then} method.
% \textbf{\texttt{Due.prototype.then(onSettlement)}}\\
% Appends settlement handlers to the due, and returns a new due resolving to the return value of the called handler.
% If the value is a \textit{thenable}, \textit{i.e.} has a method \texttt{then}, the returned due will follow that \textit{thenable}, adopting its eventual state; otherwise the returned due will be fulfilled with the value.
% We present in appendix \ref{section:dueimpl} a simple implementation of Due in Javascript.
