\subsubsection{Evaluation} \label{chapter5:due:evaluation}


% A set of Javascript projects likely to contain continuations were compiled to validate the compiler.
% This section presents the results of these tests.

% \subsection{Projects selection}

The Due compiler was evaluated against a set of Javascript projects likely to contain continuations.
Because the compilation requires user interaction to detect continuations, the test set was limited to a minimum of about \num{50} projects to conduct the test in a reasonable time.
All the projects in the set were selected from the \textit{Node Package Manager} (\textit{npm}\ftnt{https://www.npmjs.com/})  database to restrict the set to \textit{Node.js} projects \footnote{At the time of this work, \textit{npm} was still exclusive to \textit{Node.js} packages. It is now open to every Javascript packages.}.
They all depends on the web framework \textit{express}, but not on the most common Promises libraries such as \textit{Bluebird}, \textit{Q} or \textit{Async}.
They use the test frameworks \textit{mocha} in its default configuration.
These tests are used to validate the compilation results.
The test set finally contains \num{52} projects.
This subset cannot represent the wide possibilities of Javascript, but represents a majority of common cases.

Over the \num{52} packages the compiler was tested on, 43 packages were incompatible with the compiler and 9 packages were compiled with success.

% \subsection{Run the tests}

Each project passes its own tests before compilation.
During the compilation, the compatible continuations were manually identified among the detected callbacks.
The compilation result of each project is then tested again with its unmodified test.
The compilation result should pass the tests as well as the original project.
This validation assures the compiler to work as expected in most common cases.

% \subsection{Results}

Of the \num{52} projects tested, more than a half, does not contain any compatible continuations.
These projects use continuations, but the compiler discards them, because they are not declared \textit{in situ}.
The other projects were rejected by the compiler because they contain \texttt{with} or \texttt{eval} statements. %, they use Promises libraries didn't filtered previously.
\num{9} projects compiled successfully.
The compiler did not fail to compile any project of the initial test set.

Over the \num{9} successfully compiled projects, the compiler detected \num{172} callbacks.
56 of them were manually identified as compatible continuations.
The false positives are mainly the listeners that the web applications register to react to user requests.
Listeners represent the initiation of stream of data, and are addressed in the next section.

One project contains \num{20} continuations, the others contains between \num{1} and \num{9} continuations each.
On the \num{56} continuations, \num{36} are single. %, and 20 continuations are involved in an imbrication.
The other \num{20} continuations belong to imbrications of 2 to 4 continuations.
% There are 5 imbrications of 2 continuations, 2 imbrications of 3 continuations, and 1 imbrication of 4 continuations.
The result of this evaluation prove the compiler to be able to successfully transform imbrications of continuations.

On the \num{52} projects composing the test set
\begin{description}
\item[29] (55.77\%) do not contain any compatible continuations,
\item[10] (19.23\%) are not compilable because they contain \texttt{with} or \texttt{eval} statements,
\item[4] (7.69\%) fail their tests before the compilation, and
\item[9] (17.31\%) compile successfully.

% Tested applications :

% rest-api-express            -> OK

% socket-testing              -> OK (partial) the project is broken, but it seems broken in the same way before and after the compilation :)
% nodeExample                 -> OK (partial) read-simple.js and write-simple.js compile successfully (the only two files to contain continuation). but the project compiler breaks, I suspect it is because of some !# stuffs.
