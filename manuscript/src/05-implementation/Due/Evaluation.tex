\subsubsection{Evaluation} \label{chapter5:due:evaluation}

A set of Javascript projects likely to contain continuations were compiled to validate the compiler.
This section presents the results of these tests.

% \subsection{Projects selection}

This compiler has been tested over 64 \textit{Node.js} packages from the node package manager (npm\ftnt{https://www.npmjs.com/}).
55 packages were incompatible with the compiler, 9 packages were compiled with success.

The compilation of a project requires user interaction.
To conduct the test in a reasonable time, the test set was limited to a minimum of about \num{50} projects.
All the projects in the set were selected from the \textit{Node Package Manager} database to restrict the set to \textit{Node.js} projects.
They all depends on the web framework \textit{express}, but not on the most common Promises libraries such as \textit{Q} and \textit{Async}.
They use the test frameworks \textit{mocha} in its default configuration.
These tests are used to validate the compilation results.
The test set finally contains 64 projects.
This subset is very small, and cannot represent the wide possibilities of Javascript.
However, it is sufficient to represents a majority of common cases.

% \subsection{Run the tests}

Each project passes its own tests before compilation.
During the compilation, the compatible continuations were manually identified among the detected callbacks.
The compilation result of each project is then tested again with its unmodified test.
The compilation result should pass the tests as well as the original project.
This is not a strong validation, but it assures the compiler to work as expected in most common cases.

% \subsection{Results}

Of the 64 projects tested, almost a half, does not contain any compatible continuations.
These projects might use continuations, but the compiler is unable to detect them.
The other projects were rejected by the compiler because they contain \texttt{with} or \texttt{eval} statements, they use Promises libraries didn't filtered previously.
9 projects compiled successfully.
The compiler did not fail to compile any project of the initial test set.

Over the 9 successfully compiled projects, the compiler detected 172 callbacks.
56 of them were manually identified as compatible continuations.
The false positives are mainly the listeners that the web applications register to react to user requests.

One project contains 20 continuations, the others contains between 1 and 9 continuations each.
On the 56 continuations, 36 are single. %, and 20 continuations are involved in an imbrication.
The others 20 continuations belong to imbrications of 2 to 4 continuations.
% There are 5 imbrications of 2 continuations, 2 imbrications of 3 continuations, and 1 imbrication of 4 continuations.
The result of this evaluation prove the compiler to be able to successfully transform imbrications of continuations.

On the 64 projects composing the test set
\begin{description}
\item[29] (45.3\%) do not contain any compatible continuations,
\item[10] (15.6\%) are not compilable because they contain \texttt{with} or \texttt{eval} statements,
\item[5] (7.8\%) use asynchronous libraries,
\item[4] (6.3\%) are not syntactically correct,
\item[4] (6.3\%) fail their tests before the compilation,
\item[3] (4.7\%) are not tested, and
\item[10] (14.0\%) compile successfully.
\end{description}
The compiler do not fail to compile any project.
The details of these projects are available in Appendix \ref{section:results}.

% nodeExample                 -> OK (partial) read-simple.js and write-simple.js compile successfully (the only two files to contain continuation). but the project compiler breaks, I suspect it is because of some !# stuffs.
