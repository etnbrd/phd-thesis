\section{Second Step : Fluxional Compiler} \label{chapter5:flx}

% The previous section presented a compiler to identify and extract the underlying pipeline in a Javascript application.
% However, the stages doesn't enforce the isolation required for parallel execution.
% Moreover, the Dues that constitues the stages of this pipeline only parts of the pipeline are identified, 

The second contribution of this thesis is the equivalence between a global memory abstraction and a distributed memory.
% between a memory shared among all the operations and independent memory for each operation in a pipeline.
It tackles the problems arising from the replacement of the global memory synchronizations with message passing.

This equivalence is implemented as a compiler, improving upon the previous one.
The compiler transforms a Javascript application into a network of independent parts communicating by message streams and executed in parallel.

Like the previous compiler, this compiler is organized into two main steps.
The first step is the identification of the rupture points between fluxions, addressed in section \ref{chapter5:flx:compiler}.
The second step is the isolation between the fluxions, addressed in section \ref{chapter5:flx:isolation}.
% The compiler, and the equivalence are described in section \ref{chapter5:flx:compiler}.
The compiler is tested on a real-case, to expose its limits in section \ref{chapter5:flx:evaluation}.
% Section \ref{chapter5:flx:evaluation} presents a real-case test of compilation, and expose the limits of this compiler.

% We named these parts \textit{fluxions}, by contraction between a flux and a function.
% Fluxions are executed in an execution model that assure parallelism and communications.

% We present an early version of this tool as a proof of concept for this compilation approach.
% Section \ref{chapter5:flx:model} describes the execution model that executes fluxions in parallel, and assure their communications.
