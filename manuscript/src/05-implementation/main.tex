The transformation allowed by the equivalence from an event-driven program into a distributed network of fluxions is implemented incrementally into two compilers, as presented in figure \ref{fig:roadmap}.
Each compilers is divided into two steps, the identification of the rupture points separating the stages of the pipeline, and the isolation of these stages.
% This chapter presents the technical implementations of these two steps in the transformation from the event-driven execution model to the pipeline architecture
% , the transformation described in the previous chapter was implemented incrementally in two compilers.

The first compiler focuses on the identification of simple chains of causality between continuations to transform these chains into Promises.
% the transformation from continuations to Promises.
% It focuses on the identification of the chains of causality in continuations.
However, promises are more expressive than the simple chaining of causal sequentiality.
% They force another control over the execution flow.
% According to the outcome of the operation, they call one function to continue the execution with the result, or another to handle errors.
% This conditional execution is indivisible from the Promise specification.
% Promises impose a convention on how to hand back the outcome of the deferred computation, while classic continuations leave this conditional execution to the developer.
Moreover, they impose a different convention than continuations on how to hand back the outcome and errors of the deferred computation.
This difference brings unnecessary complexity to the identification of chains.
To rule out this difference between continuations and Promises, before introducing the first compiler, section \ref{chapter5:due} introduces a simpler specification to Promise, called Due.

The second compiler detects all the chains of causality between continuations and encapsulate them in fluxions.
It isolates the fluxions when possible to allow the parallelism required for efficiency.
This second compilers is introduced in section \ref{chapter5:flx}.
