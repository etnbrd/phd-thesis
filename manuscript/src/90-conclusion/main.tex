The web brought a new economic model allowing a tremendous number of business opportunities.
To seize these opportunities, a team needs to develop a web application, and grow a business around it.
The economical incentives around the technical development changes completely during the growth of this business.
In the beginning, the development needs to be productive, to quickly release a product and iterate with the user feedbacks.
When the project matures, the execution needs to be efficient, to cope with the load of a large user base while limiting the hardware costs.

These two development concerns are incompatible.
No platform can provide both performance efficiency, and development productivity at the same time.
The platforms at the state of the art propose only a fixed compromise between the two.
This thesis presented a platform allowing an evolutive compromise to fit the economical incentives.
