In conclusion, I should open on the fact that I barely reconciliated two goals in software development, 30 years or so after they were ennonciated.
But today, a third goal is increasingly taking importance, that is energy cunsumption.
I left as future work to reconciliate, in the development and execution processes of software, the three goals that are growth and maintainability, parallel and efficient execution, and efficient energy cunsumption.
