\section{Opening}

This thesis brought a possible reconciliation between two concerns in the development of a web applicaiton, the efficiency of execution and the productivity of development.
However, a third concern is currently increasingly taking importance.
The IT industry have an increasing carbon footprint.
I left as future work to reconciliate the three goals that are efficient execution, productive development, and efficient energy cunsumption.
