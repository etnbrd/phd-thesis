@article{Holtman2008,
abstract = {The universal scalability law (USL) is an analytic model used to quantify application scaling. It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and Gustafson linearized scaling as special cases. Using simulation, we show: (i) that the USL is equivalent to synchronous queueing in a load-dependent machine repairman model and (ii) how USL, Amdahl's law, and Gustafson scaling can be regarded as boundaries defining three scalability zones. Typical throughput measurements lie across all three zones. Simulation scenarios provide deeper insight into queueing effects and thus provide a clearer indication of which application features should be tuned to get into the optimal performance zone.},

abstract = {We show how to quantify scalability with the Universal Scalability Law (USL) by applying it to performance measurements of memcached, J2EE, and Weblogic on multi-core platforms. Since commercial multicores are essentially black-boxes, the accessible performance gains are primarily available at the application level. We also demonstrate how our methodology can identify the most significant performance tuning opportunities to optimize application scalability, as well as providing an easy means for exploring other aspects of the multi-core system design space.},

@inproceedings{Choudhury2011,
abstract = {The Universal Scalability Law (USL) of computational capacity has been proposed by Neil J. Gunther. USL abstracts the coefficients of inter process interactions and other contentions in the area of parallel and distributed computing in a set of constant parameters {$\sigma$, $\lambda$}. One cannot apply USL for the purpose of predicting performance, unless the values of those constant parameters are known. A computationally light weight and theoretically correct algorithm to estimate those parameters from measured performance data is not available yet. Simple linear-regression or standard least-square-error-approximation is a widely used efficient statistical technique to estimate parameters. A simple linear-regression cannot be applied directly to estimate the coefficients $\sigma$, $\lambda$ of USL, because USL is a rational function. In this work, we propose a novel and elegant algorithm based on standard least-square-error-approximation or linear-regression to estimate the parameters. The explanation of failure of simple linear-regression is discussed by visiting the basic theory of linear-regression. A novel approach, consisting of algebraic manipulations to transform the problem into two linear-regression problems, is presented. The linear-regression is applied successively in a certain order to estimate the constant parameters, $\sigma$, $\lambda$, of USL. The proposed technique is applied to a set of measured performance data to validate and verify the proposed technique.},

@inproceedings{Jr1990,
abstract = {We need a programming model that com- bines the advantages of the synchronous and asyn- chronous parallel styles. Synchronous programs are de- terminate (thus easier to reason about) and avoid syn- chronization overheads. Asynchronous programs are more flexible and handle conditionals more efficiently. Here we propose a programming model with the ben- efits of both styles. We allow asynchronous threads of control but restrict shared-memory accesses and other side effects so as to prevent the behavior of the program from depending on any accidents of execution order that can arise from the indeterminacy of the asynchronous process model. These restrictions may be enforced either dynam- ically (at run time) or statically (at compile time). In this paper we concentrate on dynamic enforcement, and exhibit an implementation of a parallel dialect of Scheme based on these ideas. A single successful exe- cution of a parallel program in this model constitutes a proof that the program is free of race conditions (for that particular set of input data). We also speculate on a design for a programming lan- guage using static enforcement. The notion of distinct- ness is important to proofs of noninterference. An ap- propriately designed programming language must sup port such concepts as “all the elements of this array are distinct,” perhaps through its type system. This parallel programming model does not support all styles of parallel programming, but we argue that it can support a large class of interesting algorithms with considerably greater efficiency (in some cases) than a strict SIMD approach and considerably greater safety (in all cases) than a full-blown MIMD approach.},
