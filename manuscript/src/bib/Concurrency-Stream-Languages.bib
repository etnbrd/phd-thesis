abstract = {In this paper, we describe a simple language for parallel programming. Its semantics is studied thoroughly. The desirable properties of this language and its deficiencies are exhibited by this theoretical study. Basic results on parallel program schemata are given. We hope in this way to make a case for a more formal (i.e. mathematical) approach to the design of languages for systems programming and the design of operating systems.},

@article{Murray2013,
abstract = {Naiad is a distributed system for executing data parallel, cyclic dataflow programs. It offers the high throughput of batch processors, the low latency of stream processors, and the ability to perform iterative and incremental computations. Although existing systems offer some of these features, applications that require all three have relied on multiple platforms, at the expense of efficiency, maintainability, and simplicity. Naiad resolves the complexities of combining these features in one framework. A new computational model, timely dataflow, underlies Naiad and captures opportunities for parallelism across a wide class of algorithms. This model enriches dataflow computation with timestamps that represent logical points in the computation and provide the basis for an efficient, lightweight coordination mechanism. We show that many powerful high-level programming models can be built on Naiad's low-level primitives, enabling such diverse tasks as streaming data analysis, iterative machine learning, and interactive graph mining. Naiad outperforms specialized systems in their target application domains, and its unique features enable the development of new high-performance applications.},

@inproceedings{Lerner2003,
abstract = {An order-dependent query is one whose result (interpreted as a multiset) changes if the order of the input records is changed. In a stock-quotes database, for instance, retriev- ing all quotes concerning a given stock for a given day does not depend on order, because the collection of quotes does not depend on order. By contrast, finding a stock’s five- price moving-average in a trades table gives a result that depends on the order of the table. Query languages based on the relational data model can handle order-dependent queries only through add-ons. SQL:1999, for instance, has a new “window” mechanism which can sort data in limited parts of a query. Add-ons make order-dependent queries difficult to write and to optimize. In this paper we show that order can be a natural property of the underlying data model and algebra. We introduce a new query language and algebra, called AQuery, that supports order from-the- ground-up. New order-related query transformations arise in this setting. We show by experiment that this framework – language plus optimization techniques – brings orders-of- magnitude improvement over SQL:1999 systems on many natural order-dependent queries.},
