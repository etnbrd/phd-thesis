@techreport{Soule2012a,
abstract = {Developers increasingly use stream processing languages to write applications
that process large volumes of data with high throughput. Unfortunately,
when choosing which stream processing language to use, they face
a difficult choice. On the one hand, dynamically scheduled languages
allow developers to write a wider range of applications, but cannot
take advantage of many crucial optimizations. On the other hand,
statically scheduled languages are extremely performant, but cannot
express many important streaming applications.

This paper presents the design of a hybrid scheduler for stream processing
languages. The compiler partitions the streaming application into
coarse-grained subgraphs sepa- rated by dynamic rate boundaries.
It then applies static op- timizations to those subgraphs. We have
implemented this scheduler as an extension to the StreamIt compiler,
and eval- uated its performance against three scheduling techniques
used by dynamic systems: OS thread, demand, and no-op. Our scheduler
not only allows the previously static version of StreamIt to run
dynamic rate applications, but it outper- forms the three dynamic
alternatives. This demonstrates that our scheduler strikes the right
balance between expressivity and performance for stream processing
languages.},

abstract = {We present OpenStream, a data-flow extension of OpenMP to express
dynamic dependent tasks. The lan- guage supports nested task creation,
modular composition, variable and unbounded sets of producers/con-
sumers, and first-class streams. These features, enabled by our original
compilation flow, allow translating high-level parallel programming
patterns, like dependences arising from StarSs? array regions, or
univer- sal low-level primitives like futures. In particular, these
dynamic features can be embedded efficiently and naturally into an
unmanaged imperative language, avoiding the complexity and overhead
of a concurrent garbage collector. We demonstrate the performance
advantages of a data-flow execution model compared to more restricted
task and barrier models. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our
compilation and runtime algorithms for the support of complex dependence
patterns arising from StarSs benchmarks.},

@phdthesis{Gordon2010,
abstract = {Given the ubiquity of multicore processors, there is an acute need
to enable the development of scalable parallel applications without
unduly burdening programmers. Currently, programmers are asked not
only to explicitly expose parallelism but also concern themselves
with issues of granu- larity, load-balancing, synchronization, and
communication. This thesis demonstrates that when algorithmic parallelism
is expressed in the form of a stream program, a compiler can effectively
and automatically manage the parallelism. Our compiler assumes responsibility
for low-level architec- tural details, transforming implicit algorithmic
parallelism into a mapping that achieves scalable parallel performance
for a given multicore target.

Stream programming is characterized by regular processing of sequences
of data, and it is a natural expression of algorithms in the areas
of audio, video, digital signal processing, network- ing, and encryption.
Streaming computation is represented as a graph of independent computa-
tion nodes that communicate explicitly over data channels. Our techniques
operate on contiguous regions of the stream graph where the input
and output rates of the nodes are statically deter- minable. Within
a static region, the compiler first automatically adjusts the granularity
and then exploits data, task, and pipeline parallelism in a holistic
fashion. We introduce techniques that data-parallelize nodes that
operate on overlapping sliding windows of their input, translating
se- rializing state into minimal and parametrized inter-core communication.
Finally, for nodes that cannot be data-parallelized due to state,
we are the first to automatically apply software-pipelining techniques
at a coarse granularity to exploit pipeline parallelism between stateful
nodes.

Our framework is evaluated in the context of the StreamIt programming
language. StreamIt is a high-level stream programming language that
has been shown to improve programmer pro- ductivity in implementing
streaming algorithms. We employ the StreamIt Core benchmark suite
of 12 real-world applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our techniques for varying multi- core architectures. For a 16-core
distributed memory multicore, we achieve a 14.9x mean speedup. For
benchmarks that include sliding-window computation, our sliding-window
data-parallelization techniques are required to enable scalable performance
for a 16-core SMP multicore (14x mean speedup) and a 64-core distributed
shared memory multicore (52x mean speedup).},

abstract = {In modern programming languages, concurrency control can be traced back to one of two different schools: actor-based message passing concurrency and thread-based shared-state concurrency. This paper describes a linguistic symbiosis between two programming languages with such different concurrency models. More specifically, we describe a novel symbiosis between actors represented as event loops on the one hand and threads on the other. This symbiosis ensures that the invariants of the actor-based concurrency model are not violated by engaging in symbiosis with multithreaded programs. The proposed mapping is validated by means of a concrete symbiosis between AmbientTalk, a flexible, domain-specific language for writing distributed programs and Java, a conventional object-oriented language. This symbiosis allows the domain-specific language to reuse existing software components written in a multithreaded language without sacrificing the beneficial event-driven properties of the actor concurrency model.},

abstract = {Stream programming is currently being pushed as a way to expose concurrency and separate communication from computation. Since there are many stream languages and potential stream execution engines, this paper proposes an abstract machine model that captures the essential characteristics of stream architectures, the Stream Virtual Machine (SVM). The goal of the SVM is to improve interoperability, allow developpment of common compilation tools and reason about stream program performance. The SVM contains control processors, slave kernel processors, and slave DMA units. Is is presented along with the compilation process that takes a stream program down to the SVM and finally down to machine binary. To extract the parameters for our SVM model, we use micro-kernels to characterize two graphics processors and a stream engine, Imagine. The results are encouraging; the model estimates the performance of the target machines with high accuracy.},

@article{Johnston2004,
abstract = {Many developments have taken place within dataflow programming languages in the past decade. In particular, there has been a great deal of activity and advancement in the field of dataflow visual programming languages. The motivation for this article is to review the content of these recent developments and how they came about. It is supported by an initial review of dataflow programming in the 1970s and 1980s that led to current topics of research. It then discusses how dataflow programming evolved toward a hybrid von Neumann dataflow formulation, and adopted a more coarse-grained approach. Recent trends toward dataflow visual programming languages are then discussed with reference to key graphical dataflow languages and their development environments. Finally, the article details four key open topics in dataflow programming languages.},

@inproceedings{Pop2011,
abstract = {This paper introduces an extension to OpenMP3.0 enabling stream programming
with minimal, incremental additions that seamlessly integrate into
the current specification. The stream programming model decomposes
programs into tasks and explicits the flow of data among them, thus
exposing data, task and pipeline parallelism. It helps the programmers
to express concurrency and data local- ity properties, avoiding non-portable
low-level code and early opti- mizations. We survey the diverse motivations
and constraints con- verging towards the design of our simple yet
powerful language extension, and we present experimental results
of a prototype im- plementation in a public branch of GCC 4.5.},

@inproceedings{Jr1990,
abstract = {We need a programming model that com- bines the advantages of the synchronous and asyn- chronous parallel styles. Synchronous programs are de- terminate (thus easier to reason about) and avoid syn- chronization overheads. Asynchronous programs are more flexible and handle conditionals more efficiently. Here we propose a programming model with the ben- efits of both styles. We allow asynchronous threads of control but restrict shared-memory accesses and other side effects so as to prevent the behavior of the program from depending on any accidents of execution order that can arise from the indeterminacy of the asynchronous process model. These restrictions may be enforced either dynam- ically (at run time) or statically (at compile time). In this paper we concentrate on dynamic enforcement, and exhibit an implementation of a parallel dialect of Scheme based on these ideas. A single successful exe- cution of a parallel program in this model constitutes a proof that the program is free of race conditions (for that particular set of input data). We also speculate on a design for a programming lan- guage using static enforcement. The notion of distinct- ness is important to proofs of noninterference. An ap- propriately designed programming language must sup port such concepts as âall the elements of this array are distinct,â perhaps through its type system. This parallel programming model does not support all styles of parallel programming, but we argue that it can support a large class of interesting algorithms with considerably greater efficiency (in some cases) than a strict SIMD approach and considerably greater safety (in all cases) than a full-blown MIMD approach.},

abstract = {The objectives in the construction of a theory of parallel programming as a basis for a high-level programming language feature are: Security from error. In many of the applications of parallel programming the cost of programming error is very high, often inhibiting the use of computers in environments for which they would otherwise be highly suitable. Parallel programs are particularly prone to time-dependent errors, which either cannot be detected by program testing nor by run-time checks. It is therefore very important that a high-level language designed for this purpose should provide complete security against time-dependent errors by means of a compile-time check. Efficiency. The spread of real-time computer applications is severely limited by computing costs; and in particular by the cost of main store. If a feature to assist in parallel programming is to be added to a language used for this purpose, it must not entail any noticeable extra run-time overhead in space or speed, neither on programs which use the feature heavily, nor on programs which do not; efficient implementation should be possible on a variety of hardware designs, both simple and complex; and there should be no need for bulky or slow compilers. Conceptual simplicity.},
