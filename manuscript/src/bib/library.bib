@article{Zaharia2012,
abstract = {Many important "big data" applications need to process data arriving in real time. However, current programming models for distributed stream processing are relatively low-level, often leaving the user to worry about consistency of state across the system and fault recovery. Furthermore, the models that provide fault recovery do so in an expensive manner, requiring either hot replication or long recovery times. We propose a new programming model, discretized streams (D-Streams), that offers a high-level functional programming API, strong consistency, and efficient fault recovery. D-Streams support a new recovery mechanism that improves efficiency over the traditional replication and upstream backup solutions in streaming databases: parallel recovery of lost state across the cluster. We have prototyped D-Streams in an extension to the Spark cluster computing framework called Spark Streaming, which lets users seamlessly intermix streaming, batch and interactive queries.},

abstract = {Rich mobile applications are characterized by rich functionality, offline usability and portability. However, it isnot trivial to simultaneously satisfy all the three criteria. Existing approaches such stand-alone applications and the thin-client architecture satisfy only a subset of these criteria. In this paper, we show that rich mobile applications can be achieved through the convergence of mobile and cloud computing. We address two main issues in cloud-enabled mobile applications, namely complexity of application development and offline usability. We then propose $\mu$Cloud framework which models a rich mobile application as a graph of components distributed onto mobile devices and the cloud. Lastly, we discuss $\mu$Cloud's major research issues, i.e., workflow language for interactive applications, offline usability, secure and scalable multi-tenancy, portability and energy optimization.},

Arrowized FRP (AFRP) is a version of FRP embedded in Haskell based on the arrow combinators. AFRP is a powerful synchronous dataflow programming language with hybrid modeling capabilities, combining advanced synchronous dataflow features with the higher-order lazy functional abstractions of Haskell. In this paper, we describe the AFRP programming style and our Haskell-based implementation. Of particular interest are the AFRP combinators that support dynamic collections and continuation-based switching. We show how these combinators can be used to express systems with an evolving structure that are difficult to model in more traditional dataflow languages.},

In this paper, we look at more closely to the relation of arrowized FRP (AFRP), the FRP implementation, and formal specification of hybrid systems. We show how a formally specified hybrid system can be expressed in FRP and present a constructive proof showing that, for a subset of AFRP programs, there is a corresponding formal hybrid system specification.},

abstract = {Stream programming is currently being pushed as a way to expose concurrency and separate communication from computation. Since there are many stream languages and potential stream execution engines, this paper proposes an abstract machine model that captures the essential characteristics of stream architectures, the Stream Virtual Machine (SVM). The goal of the SVM is to improve interoperability, allow developpment of common compilation tools and reason about stream program performance. The SVM contains control processors, slave kernel processors, and slave DMA units. Is is presented along with the compilation process that takes a stream program down to the SVM and finally down to machine binary. To extract the parameters for our SVM model, we use micro-kernels to characterize two graphics processors and a stream engine, Imagine. The results are encouraging; the model estimates the performance of the target machines with high accuracy.},

abstract = {High quality, virtual 3D models are quickly emerging as a new multimedia data type with applications in such diverse areas as e-commerce, online encyclopedias, or virtual museums, to name just a few. We present new algorithms and techniques for the acquisition and real-time interaction with complex textured 3D objects and show how these results can be seamlessly integrated with previous work into a single framework for the acquisition, processing, and interactive display of high quality 3D models. In addition to pure geometry, such algorithms also have to take into account the texture of an object (which is crucial for a realistic appearance) and its reflectance behavior. The measurement of accurate material properties is an important step towards photorealistic rendering, where both the general surface properties as well as the spatially varying effects of the object are needed. Recent work on the image-based reconstruction of spatially varying BRDFs enables the generation of high quality models of real objects from a sparse set of input data. Efficient use of the capabilities of advanced PC graphics hardware allows for interactive rendering under arbitrary viewing and lighting conditions and realistically reproduces the appearance of the original object.},

abstract = {We present OpenStream, a data-flow extension of OpenMP to express
dynamic dependent tasks. The lan- guage supports nested task creation,
modular composition, variable and unbounded sets of producers/con-
sumers, and first-class streams. These features, enabled by our original
compilation flow, allow translating high-level parallel programming
patterns, like dependences arising from StarSs? array regions, or
univer- sal low-level primitives like futures. In particular, these
dynamic features can be embedded efficiently and naturally into an
unmanaged imperative language, avoiding the complexity and overhead
of a concurrent garbage collector. We demonstrate the performance
advantages of a data-flow execution model compared to more restricted
task and barrier models. We also demonstrate the efficiency of our
compilation and runtime algorithms for the support of complex dependence
patterns arising from StarSs benchmarks.},

@techreport{Soule2012a,
abstract = {Developers increasingly use stream processing languages to write applications
that process large volumes of data with high throughput. Unfortunately,
when choosing which stream processing language to use, they face
a difficult choice. On the one hand, dynamically scheduled languages
allow developers to write a wider range of applications, but cannot
take advantage of many crucial optimizations. On the other hand,
statically scheduled languages are extremely performant, but cannot
express many important streaming applications.

This paper presents the design of a hybrid scheduler for stream processing
languages. The compiler partitions the streaming application into
coarse-grained subgraphs sepa- rated by dynamic rate boundaries.
It then applies static op- timizations to those subgraphs. We have
implemented this scheduler as an extension to the StreamIt compiler,
and eval- uated its performance against three scheduling techniques
used by dynamic systems: OS thread, demand, and no-op. Our scheduler
not only allows the previously static version of StreamIt to run
dynamic rate applications, but it outper- forms the three dynamic
alternatives. This demonstrates that our scheduler strikes the right
balance between expressivity and performance for stream processing
languages.},

In particular, there has been a great deal of activity and advancement in the field of dataflow visual programming languages. The motivation for this article is to review the content of these recent developments and how they came about. It is supported by an initial review of dataflow programming in the 1970s and 1980s that led to current topics of research. It then discusses how dataflow programming evolved toward a hybrid von Neumann dataflow formulation, and adopted a more coarse-grained approach. Recent trends toward dataflow visual programming languages are then discussed with reference to key graphical dataflow languages and their development environments. Finally, the article details four key open topics in dataflow programming languages.},

programs into tasks and explicits the flow of data among them, thus
exposing data, task and pipeline parallelism. It helps the programmers
to express concurrency and data local- ity properties, avoiding non-portable

@phdthesis{Gordon2010,
abstract = {Given the ubiquity of multicore processors, there is an acute need
to enable the development of scalable parallel applications without
unduly burdening programmers. Currently, programmers are asked not
only to explicitly expose parallelism but also concern themselves
with issues of granu- larity, load-balancing, synchronization, and
communication. This thesis demonstrates that when algorithmic parallelism
is expressed in the form of a stream program, a compiler can effectively
and automatically manage the parallelism. Our compiler assumes responsibility
for low-level architec- tural details, transforming implicit algorithmic
parallelism into a mapping that achieves scalable parallel performance
for a given multicore target.

Stream programming is characterized by regular processing of sequences
of data, and it is a natural expression of algorithms in the areas
of audio, video, digital signal processing, network- ing, and encryption.
Streaming computation is represented as a graph of independent computa-
tion nodes that communicate explicitly over data channels. Our techniques
operate on contiguous regions of the stream graph where the input
and output rates of the nodes are statically deter- minable. Within
a static region, the compiler first automatically adjusts the granularity
and then exploits data, task, and pipeline parallelism in a holistic
fashion. We introduce techniques that data-parallelize nodes that
operate on overlapping sliding windows of their input, translating
se- rializing state into minimal and parametrized inter-core communication.
Finally, for nodes that cannot be data-parallelized due to state,
we are the first to automatically apply software-pipelining techniques
at a coarse granularity to exploit pipeline parallelism between stateful
nodes.

Our framework is evaluated in the context of the StreamIt programming
language. StreamIt is a high-level stream programming language that
has been shown to improve programmer pro- ductivity in implementing
streaming algorithms. We employ the StreamIt Core benchmark suite
of 12 real-world applications to demonstrate the effectiveness of
our techniques for varying multi- core architectures. For a 16-core
distributed memory multicore, we achieve a 14.9x mean speedup. For
benchmarks that include sliding-window computation, our sliding-window
data-parallelization techniques are required to enable scalable performance
for a 16-core SMP multicore (14x mean speedup) and a 64-core distributed
shared memory multicore (52x mean speedup).},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems provide a new solution to distributed information and resource sharing because of its outstanding properties in decentralization, dynamics, flexibility, autonomy, and cooperation, summarized as DDFAC in this paper. After a detailed analysis of the current P2P literature, this paper suggests to better exploit peer social relationships and peer autonomy to achieve efficient P2P structure design. Accordingly, this paper proposes Self-organizing peer-to-peer social networks (SoPPSoNs) to self-organize distributed peers in a decentralized way, inwhich neuron-like agents following extended Hebbian rules found in the brain activity represent peers to discover useful peer connections. The self-organized networks capture social associations of peers in resource sharing, and hence are called P2P social networks.SoPPSoNshave improved search speed and success rate as peer social networks are correctly formed. This has been verified through tests on real data collected from the Gnutella system. Analysis on the Gnutella data has verified that social associations of peers in reality are directed, asymmetric and weighted, validating the design of SoPPSoN. The tests presented in this paper have also evaluated the scalability of SoPPSoN, its performance under varied initial network connectivity and the effects of different learning rules.},

abstract = {Functional reactive programming (FRP) has simple and powerful semantics, but has resisted efficient implementation. In particular, most past implementations have used demand-driven sampling, which accommodates FRP's continuous time semantics and fits well with the nature of functional programming. Consequently, values are wastefully recomputed even when inputs don't change, and reaction latency can be as high as the sampling period. This paper presents a way to implement FRP that combines data- and demand-driven evaluation, in which values are recomputed only when necessary, and reactions are nearly instantaneous. The implementation is rooted in a new simple formulation of FRP and its semantics and so is easy to understand and reason about. On the road to a new implementation, we'll meet some old friends (monoids, functors, applicative functors, monads, morphisms, and improving values) and make some new friends (functional future values, reactive normal form, and concurrent "unambiguous choice").},

abstract = {Today's online social networking (OSN) sites do little to protect the privacy of their users' social networking information. Given the highly sensitive nature of the information these sites store, it is understandable that many users feel victimized and disempowered by OSN providers' terms of service. This paper presents Lockr, a system that improves the privacy of centralized and decentralized online content sharing systems. Lockr offers three significant privacy benefits to OSN users. First, it separates social networking content from all other functionality that OSNs provide. This decoupling lets users control their own social information: they can decide which OSN provider should store it, which third parties should have access to it, or they can even choose to manage it themselves. Such flexibility better accommodates OSN users' privacy needs and preferences. Second, Lockr ensures that digitally signed social relationships needed to access social data cannot be re-used by the OSN for unintended purposes. This feature drastically reduces the value to others of social content that users entrust to OSN providers. Finally, Lockr enables message encryption using a social relationship key. This key lets two strangers with a common friend verify their relationship without exposing it to others, a common privacy threat when sharing data in a decentralized scenario. This paper relates Lockr's design and implementation and shows how we integrate it with Flickr, a centralized OSN, and BitTorrent, a decentralized one. Our implementation demonstrates Lockr's critical primary benefits for privacy as well as its secondary benefits for simplifying site management and accelerating content delivery. These benefits were achieved with negligible performance cost and overhead.},

abstract = {Provided certain obstacles are overcome, we believe Cloud Computing has the potential to transform a large part of the IT industry, making software even more attractive as a service and shaping the way IT hardware is designed and purchased. Developers with innovative ideas for new interactive Internet services no longer require the large capital outlays in hardware to deploy their service or the human expense to operate it. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, thus wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, thus missing potential customers and revenue. Moreover, companies with large batch-oriented tasks can get their results as quickly as their programs can scale, since using 1000 servers for one hour costs no more than using one server for 1000 hours. This elasticity of resources, without paying a premium for large scale, is unprecedented in the history of IT. The economies of scale of very large-scale datacenters combined with ``pay-as-you-go'' resource usage has heralded the rise of Cloud Computing. It is now attractive to deploy an innovative new Internet service on a third party's Internet Datacenter rather than your own infrastructure, and to gracefully scale its resources as it grows or declines in popularity and revenue. Expanding and shrinking daily in response to normal diurnal patterns could lower costs even further. Cloud Computing transfers the risks of over-provisioning or under-provisioning to the Cloud Computing provider, who mitigates that risk by statistical multiplexing over a much larger set of users and who offers relatively low prices due better utilization and from the economy of purchasing at a larger scale. We define terms, present an economic model that quantifies the key buy vs. pay-as-you-go decision, offer a spectrum to classify Cloud Computing providers, and give our view of the top 10 obstacles and opportunities to the growth of Cloud Computing.},

I'm talking about cloud computing, where applications and files are hosted on a "cloud" consisting of thousands of computers and servers, all linked together and accessible via the Internet. With cloud computing, everything you do is now web based instead of being desktop based. You can access all your programs and documents from any computer that's connected to the Internet. How will cloud computing change the way you work? For one thing, you're no longer tied to a single computer. You can take your work anywhere because it's always accessible via the web. In addition, cloud computing facilitates group collaboration, as all group members can access the same programs and documents from wherever they happen to be located. Cloud computing might sound far-fetched, but chances are you're already using some cloud applications. If you're using a web-based email program, such as Gmail or Hotmail, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a web-based application such as Google Calendar or Apple Mobile Me, you're computing in the cloud. If you're using a file- or photo-sharing site, such as Flickr or Picasa Web Albums, you're computing in the cloud. It's the technology of the future, available to use today.},

abstract = {MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets. Users specify a map function that processes a key/value pair to generate a set of intermediate key/value pairs, and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key. Many real world tasks are expressible in this model, as shown in the paper. Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines. The run-time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data, scheduling the program’s execution across a set of machines, handling machine failures, and managing the required inter-machine communication. This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system. Our implementation of MapReduce runs on a large cluster of commodity machines and is highly scalable: a typical MapReduce computation processes many terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Programmers find the system easy to use: hundreds of MapReduce programs have been implemented and upwards of one thousand MapReduce jobs are executed on Google’s clusters every day.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. 1.},

abstract = {This work addresses the need for stateful dataflow programs that can rapidly sift through huge, evolving data sets. These data-intensive applications perform complex multi-step computations over successive generations of data inflows, such as weekly web crawls, daily image/video uploads, log files, and growing social networks. While programmers may simply re-run the entire dataflow when new data arrives, this is grossly inefficient, increasing result latency and squandering hardware resources and energy. Alternatively, programmers may use prior results to incrementally incorporate the changes. However, current large-scale data processing tools, such as Map-Reduce or Dryad, limit how programmers incorporate and use state in data-parallel programs. Straightforward approaches to incorporating state can result in custom, fragile code and disappointing performance. This work presents a generalized architecture for continuous bulk processing (CBP) that raises the level of abstraction for building incremental applications. At its core is a flexible, groupwise processing operator that takes state as an explicit input. Unifying stateful programming with a data-parallel operator affords several fundamental opportunities for minimizing the movement of data in the underlying processing system. As case studies, we show how one can use a small set of flexible dataflow primitives to perform web analytics and mine large-scale, evolving graphs in an incremental fashion. Experiments with our prototype using real-world data indicate significant data movement and running time reductions relative to current practice. For example, incrementally computing PageRank using CBP can reduce data movement by 46% and cut running time in half.},

abstract = {S4 is a general-purpose, distributed, scalable, partially fault-tolerant, pluggable platform that allows programmers to easily develop applications for processing continuous unbounded streams of data. Keyed data events are routed with affinity to Processing Elements (PEs), which consume the events and do one or both of the following: (1) emit one or more events which may be consumed by other PEs, (2) publish results. The architecture resembles the Actors model, providing semantics of encapsulation and location transparency, thus allowing applications to be massively concurrent while exposing a simple programming interface to application developers. In this paper, we outline the S4 architecture in detail, describe various applications, including real-life deployments. Our design is primarily driven by large scale applications for data mining and machine learning in a production environment. We show that the S4 design is surprisingly flexible and lends itself to run in large clusters built with commodity hardware.},

@article{Bhatotia2011,
abstract = {Many online data sets evolve over time as new entries are slowly added and existing entries are deleted or modified. Taking advantage of this, systems for incremental bulk data processing, such as Google's Percolator, can achieve efficient updates. To achieve this efficiency, however, these systems lose compatibility with the simple programming models offered by non-incremental systems, e.g., MapReduce, and more importantly, requires the programmer to implement application-specific dynamic algorithms, ultimately increasing algorithm and code complexity. In this paper, we describe the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of Incoop, a generic MapReduce framework for incremental computations. Incoop detects changes to the input and automatically updates the output by employing an efficient, fine-grained result reuse mechanism. To achieve efficiency without sacrificing transparency, we adopt recent advances in the area of programming languages to identify the shortcomings of task-level memoization approaches, and to address these shortcomings by using several novel techniques: a storage system, a contraction phase for Reduce tasks, and an affinity-based scheduling algorithm. We have implemented Incoop by extending the Hadoop framework, and evaluated it by considering several applications and case studies. Our results show significant performance improvements without changing a single line of application code.},

abstract = {Building highly concurrent systems, such as large-scale Internet services, requires managing many information flows at once and maintaining peak throughput when demand exceeds resource availability. In addition, any platform supporting Internet services must provide high availability and be able to cope with burstiness of load. Many approaches to building concurrent systems have been proposed, which generally fall into the two categories of threaded and event- driven programming. We propose that threads and events are actually on the ends of a design spectrum, and that the best implementation strategy for these applications is somewhere in between. We present a general-purpose design framework for building highly concurrent systems, based on three design components — tasks, queues, and thread pools — which encapsulate the concurrency, performance, fault isolation, and software engineering benefits of both threads and events. We present a set of design patterns that can be applied to map an application onto an implementation using these components. In addition, we provide an analysis of several systems (including an Internet services platform and a highly available, distributed, persistent data store) constructed using our framework, demonstrating its benefit for building and reasoning about concurrent applications.},

abstract = {This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in that companys Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997. That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in nature. The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June 2002. Since publication of the third edition, ECMAScript has achieved massive adoption in conjunction with the World Wide Web where it has become the programming language that is supported by essentially all web browsers. Significant work was done to develop a fourth edition of ECMAScript. Although that work was not completed and not published1 as the fourth edition of ECMAScript, it informs continuing evolution of the language. The present fifth edition of ECMAScript (published as ECMA-262 5th edition) codifies de facto interpretations of the language specification that have become common among browser implementations and adds support for new features that have emerged since the publication of the third edition. Such features include accessor properties, reflective creation and inspection of objects, program control of property attributes, additional array manipulation functions, support for the JSON object encoding format, and a strict mode that provides enhanced error checking and program security. ECMAScript is a vibrant language and the evolution of the language is not complete. Significant technical enhancement will continue with future editions of this specification.},

@article{VanCutsem2009,
abstract = {In modern programming languages, concurrency control can be traced back to one of two different schools: actor-based message passing concurrency and thread-based shared-state concurrency. This paper describes a linguistic symbiosis between two programming languages with such different concurrency models. More specifically, we describe a novel symbiosis between actors represented as event loops on the one hand and threads on the other. This symbiosis ensures that the invariants of the actor-based concurrency model are not violated by engaging in symbiosis with multithreaded programs. The proposed mapping is validated by means of a concrete symbiosis between AmbientTalk, a flexible, domain-specific language for writing distributed programs and Java, a conventional object-oriented language. This symbiosis allows the domain-specific language to reuse existing software components written in a multithreaded language without sacrificing the beneficial event-driven properties of the actor concurrency model.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design of a new Web server architecture called the asymmetric multi-process event- driven (AMPED) architecture, and evaluates the perfor- mance of an implementation of this architecture, the Flash Web server. The Flash Web server combines the high performance of single-process event-driven servers on cached workloads with the performance of multi- process and multi-threaded servers on disk-bound work- loads. Furthermore, the Flash Web server is easily portable since it achieves these results using facilities available in all modern operating systems. The performance of different Web server architec- tures is evaluated in the context of a single implemen- tation in order to quantify the impact of a server’s con- currency architecture on its performance. Furthermore, the performance of Flash is compared with two widely- used Web servers, Apache and Zeus. Results indicate that Flash can match or exceed the performance of exist- ing Web servers by up to 50% across a wide range of real workloads. We also present results that show the contri- bution of various optimizations embedded in Flash.},

Node.js becomes popular and successful to build data-intensive web applications. To study and compare the performance of Node.js, Python-Web and PHP, we used benchmark tests and scenario tests. The experimental results yield some valuable performance data, showing that PHP and Python-Web handle much less requests than that of Node.js in a certain time. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that Node.js is quite lightweight and efficient, which is an idea fit for I/O intensive websites among the three, while PHP is only suitable for small and middle scale applications, and Python-Web is developer friendly and good for large web architectures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate these Web programming technologies with both objective systematic tests (benchmark) and realistic user behavior tests (scenario), especially taking Node.js as the main topic to discuss.},

It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and Gustafson linearized scaling as special cases. Using simulation, we show: (i) that the USL is equivalent to synchronous queueing in a load-dependent machine repairman model and (ii) how USL, Amdahl's law, and Gustafson scaling can be regarded as boundaries defining three scalability zones. Typical throughput measurements lie across all three zones. Simulation scenarios provide deeper insight into queueing effects and thus provide a clearer indication of which application features should be tuned to get into the optimal performance zone.},

We prove that C_p is equivalent to the synchronous throughput bound for a machine-repairman with state-dependent service rate. Simpler rational functions, such as Amdahl's law and Gustafson speedup, are corollaries of this queue-theoretic bound.

abstract = {The Universal Scalability Law (USL) of computational capacity has been proposed by Neil J. Gunther. USL abstracts the coefficients of inter process interactions and other contentions in the area of parallel and distributed computing in a set of constant parameters {$\sigma$, $\lambda$}. One cannot apply USL for the purpose of predicting performance, unless the values of those constant parameters are known. A computationally light weight and theoretically correct algorithm to estimate those parameters from measured performance data is not available yet. Simple linear-regression or standard least-square-error-approximation is a widely used efficient statistical technique to estimate parameters. A simple linear-regression cannot be applied directly to estimate the coefficients $\sigma$, $\lambda$ of USL, because USL is a rational function. In this work, we propose a novel and elegant algorithm based on standard least-square-error-approximation or linear-regression to estimate the parameters. The explanation of failure of simple linear-regression is discussed by visiting the basic theory of linear-regression. A novel approach, consisting of algebraic manipulations to transform the problem into two linear-regression problems, is presented. The linear-regression is applied successively in a certain order to estimate the constant parameters, $\sigma$, $\lambda$, of USL. The proposed technique is applied to a set of measured performance data to validate and verify the proposed technique.},

@article{Sussman1998,
abstract = {Inspired byACTORS[7, 17], we have implemented an interpreter for a LISP-like language, SCHEME, based on the lambda calculus [2], but extended for side effects, multiprocessing, and process synchronization. The purpose of this implementation is tutorial. We wish to: 1. alleviate the confusion caused by Micro-PLANNER, CONNIVER, etc., by clarifying the embedding of non-recursive control structures in a recursive host language like LISP. 2. explain how to use these control structures, independent of such issues as pattern matching and data base manipulation. 3. have a simple concrete experimental domain for certain issues of programming semantics and style. This paper is organized into sections. The first section is a short “reference manual” containing specifications for all the unusual features of SCHEME. Next, we present a sequence of programming examples which illustrate various programming styles, and how to use them. This will raise certain issues of semantics which we will try to clarify with lambda calculus in the third section. In the fourth section we will give a general discussion of the issues facing an implementor of an interpreter for a language based on lambda calculus. Finally, we will present a completely annotated interpreter for SCHEME, written in MacLISP [13], to acquaint programmers with the tricks of the trade of implementing non-recursive control structures in a recursive language like LISP. This report describes research done at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Support for the laboratory’s artificial intelligence research is provided in part by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense under Office of Naval Research contract N00014-75-C- 0643. 1.},

The effectiveness of a \&quot;modularization \&quot; is dependent upon the criteria used in dividing the system into modules. A system design problem is presented and both a conventional and unconventional decomposition are described. It is shown that the unconventional decompositions have distinct advantages for the goals outlined. The criteria used in arriving at the decom-positions are discussed. The unconventional decomposi-tion, if implemented with the conventional assumption that a module consists of one or more subroutines, will be less efficient in most cases. An alternative approach to implementation which does not have this effect is sketched.},

@article{Matsakis2012a,
abstract = {This paper presents a lightweight task framework and accompanying type system that statically guarantee deterministic execution. The framework is based on the familiar model of fork-join parallelism, but with two important twists. First, child tasks do not begin execution immediately upon creation, but rather they are both scheduled and joined as one atomic action; this change prevents the parent task from racing with its children. Second, the body of a child task is specified as a parallel closure. Parallel closures are a novel variation on traditional closures in which the data inherited from the environment is read-only. Parallel closures have the important property that they can be executed in parallel with one another without creating data races, even if they share the same environment. We also have a controlled means to grant mutable access to data in the environment where necessary. We have implemented a prototype of our framework in Java. The prototype includes a typechecker that enforces the constraint that parallel closures cannot modify their environment. The paper describes how the prototype has been used to implement a number of realistic examples and also explains how parallel closures can support the creation of structured parallel programming abstractions.},

abstract = {Many problem factors in the software development phase affect the maintainability of the delivered software systems. Therefore, understanding software development problem factors can help in not only reducing the incidence of project failure but can also ensure software maintainability. This study focuses on those software development problem factors which may possibly affect software maintainability. Twenty-five problem factors were classified into five dimensions; a questionnaire was designed and 137 software projects were surveyed. A K-means cluster analysis was performed to classify the projects into three groups of low, medium and high maintainability projects. For projects which had a higher level of severity of problem factors, the influence on software maintainability becomes more obvious. The influence of software process improvement (SPI) on project problems and the associated software maintainability was also examined in this study. Results suggest that SPI can help reduce the level of severity of the documentation quality and process management problems, and is only likely to enhance software maintainability to a medium level. Finally, the top 10 list of higher-severity software development problem factors was identified, and implications were discussed.},

In the extended calculus, restriction is viewed formally as a binder, and the calculus allows dynamic change of scope (of label) in connection with communication. It is proved that algebraic properties of strong (and observational) equivalence for CCS are preserved by the extension.  Examples illustrating the expressive power of the calculus and its  methods for reasoning are given.},

@incollection{Hoare2002,
abstract = {The objectives in the construction of a theory of parallel programming as a basis for a high-level programming language feature are: Security from error. In many of the applications of parallel programming the cost of programming error is very high, often inhibiting the use of computers in environments for which they would otherwise be highly suitable. Parallel programs are particularly prone to time-dependent errors, which either cannot be detected by program testing nor by run-time checks. It is therefore very important that a high-level language designed for this purpose should provide complete security against time-dependent errors by means of a compile-time check. Efficiency. The spread of real-time computer applications is severely limited by computing costs; and in particular by the cost of main store. If a feature to assist in parallel programming is to be added to a language used for this purpose, it must not entail any noticeable extra run-time overhead in space or speed, neither on programs which use the feature heavily, nor on programs which do not; efficient implementation should be possible on a variety of hardware designs, both simple and complex; and there should be no need for bulky or slow compilers. Conceptual simplicity.},

General-purpose computing capacity grew at an annual rate of 58%. The world's capacity for bidirectional telecommunication grew at 28% per year, closely followed by the increase in globally stored information (23%). Humankind's capacity for unidirectional information diffusion through broadcasting channels has experienced comparatively modest annual growth (6%). Telecommunication has been dominated by digital technologies since 1990 (99.9% in digital format in 2007), and the majority of our technological memory has been in digital format since the early 2000s (94% digital in 2007).},

abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) and Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) are considered as a powerful combination for supporting enterprise’s success. While BPM addresses the (goal-driven) design, deployment, and continuous evaluation of business processes, SOA promises a supporting IT paradigm to make process applications and thus enterprises more agile and flexible. Nevertheless, there is still a gap between business and IT, as the services provided by an SOA cannot - until now - support the business processes immediately. In this paper, we focus on the transition between the design and the deployment of business processes and present our ideas on how this transition could be streamlined by a better alignment of BPM and SOA. Based on systems engineering and product line experience, we identify solution principles and discuss related questions.},

abstract = {Deployment patterns have been proposed as a mechanism to support the provisioning of SOA-based services. Deployment patterns represent the structure and constraints of composite solutions, including non-functional properties, such as performance, availability, and security, without binding to specific resource instances. In previous work [1], we have presented a formal mechanism for capturing such service deployment patterns using models. Our pattern models define abstract connectivity and configuration requirements which are then realized by an existing or planned infrastructure. Realization mapping is used to enforce policies, and is materialized at deployment time. In this paper we extend that work to address the problem of automatic pattern realization over a given infrastructure. We first formalize the problem and present three variations of increasing power and complexity. We then present a variation of a search-based graph isomorphism algorithm with extensions for our pattern model semantics. Next, we show that our worst-case exponential complexity algorithm performs well in practice, over a number of pattern and infrastructure combinations. We speculate that this is because deployment topologies represent heavily labeled and sparse graphs. We present a number of heuristics which we have compared experimentally, and have identified one which performs best across most scenarios. Our algorithm has been incorporated into a large deployment modeling platform, now part of the IBM Rational Software Architect (RSA) tool [2].},

abstract = {An order-dependent query is one whose result (interpreted as a multiset) changes if the order of the input records is changed. In a stock-quotes database, for instance, retriev- ing all quotes concerning a given stock for a given day does not depend on order, because the collection of quotes does not depend on order. By contrast, finding a stock’s five- price moving-average in a trades table gives a result that depends on the order of the table. Query languages based on the relational data model can handle order-dependent queries only through add-ons. SQL:1999, for instance, has a new “window” mechanism which can sort data in limited parts of a query. Add-ons make order-dependent queries difficult to write and to optimize. In this paper we show that order can be a natural property of the underlying data model and algebra. We introduce a new query language and algebra, called AQuery, that supports order from-the- ground-up. New order-related query transformations arise in this setting. We show by experiment that this framework – language plus optimization techniques – brings orders-of- magnitude improvement over SQL:1999 systems on many natural order-dependent queries.},

abstract = {Managing data and computation is at the heart of datacenter computing. Manual management of data can lead to data loss, wasteful consumption of storage, and laborious bookkeeping. Lack of proper management of computation can result in lost opportunities to share common computations across multiple jobs or to compute results incrementally. Nectar is a system designed to address the aforementioned problems. It automates and unifies the management of data and computation within a datacenter. In Nectar, data and computation are treated interchangeably by associating data with its computation. Derived datasets, which are the results of computations, are uniquely identified by the programs that produce them, and together with their programs, are automatically managed by a datacenter wide caching service. Any derived dataset can be transparently regenerated by re-executing its program, and any computation can be transparently avoided by using previously cached results. This enables us to greatly improve datacenter management and resource utilization: obsolete or infrequently used derived datasets are automatically garbage collected, and shared common computations are computed only once and reused by others. This paper describes the design and implementation of Nectar, and reports on our evaluation of the system using analytic studies of logs from several production clusters and an actual deployment on a 240-node cluster.},

abstract = {Naiad is a distributed system for executing data parallel, cyclic dataflow programs. It offers the high throughput of batch processors, the low latency of stream processors, and the ability to perform iterative and incremental computations. Although existing systems offer some of these features, applications that require all three have relied on multiple platforms, at the expense of efficiency, maintainability, and simplicity. Naiad resolves the complexities of combining these features in one framework. A new computational model, timely dataflow, underlies Naiad and captures opportunities for parallelism across a wide class of algorithms. This model enriches dataflow computation with timestamps that represent logical points in the computation and provide the basis for an efficient, lightweight coordination mechanism. We show that many powerful high-level programming models can be built on Naiad's low-level primitives, enabling such diverse tasks as streaming data analysis, iterative machine learning, and interactive graph mining. Naiad outperforms specialized systems in their target application domains, and its unique features enable the development of new high-performance applications.},

While on the micro-level this system is modular, how should the building blocks be arranged on the macro-level? In the literature this question has mainly been addressed with the same arguments already used to advocate modularity on the micro-level: Dependencies should be minimized as they impede optimization and flexibility of the system. In contrast to this I argue that along with a change from the micro view to the macro view also the argumentation has to change. In this paper, I analyze the theoretical ramifications of dependency between modules on the macro-level. In particular, I argue that macro-level dependencies are first weak dependencies, and second, foster flexibility and change efficiency. This argumentation is supported by an empirical analysis of 35 software architectures. Data show that dependency relations seldom cause change propagation. F...},

abstract = {We live in a dynamic economic and commerical world, surrounded by objects of remarkable complexity and power. In many industries, changes in products and technologies have brought with them new kinds of firms and forms of organization. We are discovering news ways of structuring work, of bringing buyers and sellers together, and of creating and using market information. Although our fast-moving economy often seems to be outside of our influence or control, human beings create the things that create the market forces. Devices, software programs, production processes, contracts, firms, and markets are all the fruit of purposeful action: they are designed.Using the computer industry as an example, Carliss Y. Baldwin and Kim B. Clark develop a powerful theory of design and industrial evolution. They argue that the industry has experienced previously unimaginable levels of innovation and growth because it embraced the concept of modularity, building complex products from smaller subsystems that can be designed independently yet function together as a whole. Modularity freed designers to experiment with different approaches, as long as they obeyed the established design rules. Drawing upon the literatures of industrial organization, real options, and computer architecture, the authors provide insight into the forces of change that drive today's economy.},

@incollection{Dijkstra1982,
abstract = {Since the summer of 1973, when I became a Burroughs Research Fellow, my life has been very different from what it had been before. The daily routine changed: instead of going to the University each day, where I used to spend most of my time in the company of others, I now went there only one day a week and was most of the time that is, when not travelling!-- alone in my study. In my solitude, mail and the written word in general became more and more important. The circumstance that my employer and I had the Atlantic Ocean between us was a further incentive to keep a fairly complete record of what I was doing. The public part of that output found its place in what became known as "the EWD series", which can be viewed as a form of scientific correspondence, possible since the advent of the copier. (That same copier makes it hard to estimate its actual distribution: I myself made about two dozen copies of my texts, but their recipients were welcome to act as further nodes of the distribution tree.) The decision to publish a selection from the EWD series in book form was at first highly embarrassing, but as the months went by I got used to the idea. As soon as some guiding principles had been adopted -- preferably not published elsewhere, as varied and as representative as possible, etc.-- the actual selection process was much easier than I had feared. Harder to decide was the question to how much editing the selected texts should be subjected. When the texts are viewed as historical documents, their editing should be minimal. When David Gries went through the texts with his fine-toothed comb he revealed so many opportunities for improvement that, eventually, the editing became quite extensive. As a result, the texts as published are not representative of my mastery of the English language. A major obstacle to publication was my insistence that selected trip reports be included. Having decided that the selection should be representative, I had no choice, since the period in question covers years during which I was on the road a third of the time. Furthermore, few of my texts reflect my feelings and attitudes more clearly than the trip reports. (It has been remarked that my trip reports are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited.) There was only one snag: there is no tradition of publishing such comments. While performing artists are quite used to being judged publicly by their peers, performing scientists are not. (Reviews of published books and articles are the closest approximation.)},

abstract = {Done well, separation of concerns can provide many software engineering benefits, including reduced complexity, improved reusability, and simpler evolution. The choice of boundaries for separate concerns depends on both requirements on the system and on the kind(s) of decomposition and composition a given formalism supports. The predominant methodologies and formalisms available, however, support only orthogonal separations of concerns, along single dimensions of composition and decomposition. These characteristics lead to a number of well-known and difficult problems. The paper describes a new paradigm for modeling and implementing software artifacts, one that permits separation of overlapping concerns along multiple dimensions of composition and decomposition. This approach addresses numerous problems throughout the software lifecycle in achieving well-engineered, evolvable, flexible software artifacts and traceability across artifacts.},

abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write, easy to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be re-used to reduce future programming costs. Conventional languages place con- ceptual limits on the way problems can be modularised. Functional lan- guages push those limits back. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy eval- uation, can contribute greatly to modularity. As examples, we manipu- late lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artificial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). Since modularity is the key to successful pro- gramming, functional languages are vitally important to the real world.},

abstract = {Various research communities have independently arrived at stream processing as a programming model for efficient and parallel computing. These communities include digital signal processing, databases, operating systems, and complex event processing. Since each community faces applications with challenging performance requirements, each of them has developed some of the same optimizations, but often with conflicting terminology and unstated assumptions. This article presents a survey of optimizations for stream processing. It is aimed both at users who need to understand and guide the system’s optimizer and at implementers who need to make engineering tradeoffs. To consolidate terminology, this article is organized as a catalog, in a style similar to catalogs of design patterns or refactorings. To make assumptions explicit and help understand tradeoffs, each optimization is presented with its safety constraints (when does it preserve correctness?) and a profitability experiment (when does it improve performance?). We hope that this survey will help future streaming system builders to stand on the shoulders of giants from not just their own community.},

abstract = {Lock-free shared data structures in the setting of distributed computing have received a fair amount of attention. Major motivations of lock-free data structures include increasing fault tolerance of a (possibly heterogeneous) system and alleviating the problems associated with critical sections such as priority inversion and deadlock. For parallel computers with tightly-coupled processors and shared memory, these issues are no longer major concerns. While many of the results are applicable especially when the model used is shared memory multiprocessors, no prior studies have considered improving the performance of a parallel implementation by way of lock-free programming. As a matter of fact, often times in practice lock-free data structures in a distributed setting do not perform as well as those that use locks. As the data structures and algorithms for parallel computing are often drastically different from those in distributed computing, it is possible that lock-free programs perform better. In this paper we compare the similarity and difference of lock-free programming in both distributed and parallel computing environments and explore the possibility of adapting lock-free programming to parallel computing to improve performance. Lock-free programming also provides a new way of simulating PRAM and asynchronous PRAM algorithms on current parallel machines.},

abstract = {We present an efficient and practical lock-free implementation of a concurrent priority queue that is suitable for both fully concurrent (large multi-processor) systems as well as pre-emptive (multi-process) systems. Many algorithms for concurrent priority queues are based on mutual exclusion. However, mutual exclusion causes blocking which has several drawbacks and degrades the system's overall performance. Non-blocking algorithms avoid blocking, and are either lock-free or wait-free. Previously known non-blocking algorithms of priority queues did not perform well in practice because of their complexity, and they are often based on non-available atomic synchronization primitives. Our algorithm is based on the randomized sequential list structure called Skiplist, and a real-time extension of our algorithm is also described. In our performance evaluation we compare our algorithm with some of the most efficient implementations of priority queues known. The experimental results clearly show that our lock-free implementation outperforms the other lock-based implementations in all cases for 3 threads and more, both on fully concurrent as well as on pre-emptive systems.},

Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called HOGWILD! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Recent advances in multi-core and many-core processors re- quires programmers to exploit an increasing amount of par- allelism from their applications. Data parallel languages such as CUDA and OpenCL make it possible to take ad- vantage of such processors, but still require a large amount of effort from programmers. A number of parallelizing source-to-source compilers have recently been developed to ease programming of multi-core and many-core processors. This work presents and evalu- ates a number of such tools, focused in particular on C-to- CUDA transformations targeting GPUs. We compare these tools both qualitatively and quantitatively to each other and identify their strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we address the weaknesses by presenting a new classification of algorithms. This classification is used in a new source-to-source compiler, which is based on the algo- rithmic skeletons technique. The compiler generates target code based on skeletons of parallel structures, which can be seen as parameterisable library implementations for a set of algorithm classes. We furthermore demonstrate that the presented compiler requires little modifications to the original sequential source code, generates readable code for further fine-tuning, and delivers superior performance compared to other tools for a set of 8 image processing kernels.},

@inproceedings{Vandierendonck2010a,
abstract = {Speeding up sequential programs on multicores is a challenging problem that is in urgent need of a solution. Automatic paral- lelization of irregular pointer-intensive codes, exemplified by the SPECint codes, is a very hard problem. This paper shows that, with a helping hand, such auto-parallelization is possible and fruitful. This paper makes the following contributions: (i) A compiler- framework for extracting pipeline-like parallelism from outer pro- gram loops is presented. (ii) Using a light-weight programming model based on annotations, the programmer helps the compiler to find thread-level parallelism. Each of the annotations specifies only a small piece of semantic information that compiler analy- sis misses, e.g. stating that a variable is dead at a certain program point. The annotations are designed such that correctness is eas- ily verified. Furthermore, we present a tool for suggesting annota- tions to the programmer. (iii) The methodology is applied to auto- parallelize several SPECint benchmarks. For the benchmark with most parallelism (hmmer), we obtain a scalable 7-fold speedup on an AMD quad-core dual processor. The annotations constitute a parallel programming model that relies extensively on a sequential program representation. Hereby, the complexity of debugging is not increased and it does not ob- scure the source code. These properties could prove valuable to increase the efficiency of parallel programming.},

Significant parts of the SpecFP and PerfectClub benchmarks are ACLs. They often contain reductions: associative and commutative operators applied to a collection of values. They also often exhibit reuse: intermediate values computed or used at different index points being identical. We develop various techniques to automatically exploit reuse to simplify the computational complexity of evaluating reductions.

@phdthesis{Mendis2015,
abstract = {Highly optimized programs are prone to bit rot, where performance quickly becomes sub- optimal in the face of new hardware and compiler techniques. In this paper we show how to automatically lift performance-critical stencil kernels from a stripped x86 binary and generate the corresponding code in the high-level domain-specific language Halide. Using Halide’s state-of-the-art optimizations targeting current hardware, we show that new opti- mized versions of these kernels can replace the originals to rejuvenate the application for newer hardware. The original optimized code for kernels in stripped binaries is nearly impossible to analyze statically. Instead, we rely on dynamic traces to regenerate the kernels. We perform buffer structure reconstruction to identify input, intermediate and output buffer shapes. We ab- stract from a forest of concrete dependency trees which contain absolute memory addresses to symbolic trees suitable for high-level code generation. This is done by canonicalizing trees, clustering them based on structure, inferring higher-dimensional buffer accesses and finally by solving a set of linear equations based on buffer accesses to lift them up to simple, high-level expressions. Helium can handle highly optimized, complex stencil kernels with input-dependent con- ditionals. We lift seven kernels from Adobe Photoshop giving a 75% performance improve- ment, four kernels from IrfanView, leading to 4.97× performance, and one stencil from the miniGMG multigrid benchmark netting a 4.25× improvement in performance. We manually rejuvenated Photoshop by replacing eleven of Photoshop’s filters with our lifted implemen- tations, giving 1.12× speedup without affecting the user experience.},

It is used to compute large amounts of data in the form of continuous data streams. Each computation is represented by a data stream graph, usually a directed graph. In this paper, the computing paradigm of big data stream computation in data stream graph is given, and some application scenarios and big data stream characteristics are presented. A series of challenges in designing a scalable big data stream computing system in big data environments are summarised by referring to some research results of big data stream computing system, which include stateless system architecture, elastically adaptive scheduling strategy and fine-grained fault tolerance strategy.

@book{Sussman1983,
abstract = {Abelson and Sussman's classic "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together. The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?" The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming. This edition available only OUTSIDE the U.S. and Canada},

abstract = {This innovative text presents computer programming as a unified discipline in a way that is both practical and scientifically sound. The book focuses on techniques of lasting value and explains them precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. The book presents all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework that shows their deep relationships and how and where to use them together. After an introduction to programming concepts, the book presents both well-known and lesser-known computation models ("programming paradigms"). Each model has its own set of techniques and each is included on the basis of its usefulness in practice. The general models include declarative programming, declarative concurrency, message-passing concurrency, explicit state, object-oriented programming, shared-state concurrency, and relational programming. Specialized models include graphical user interface programming, distributed programming, and constraint programming. Each model is based on its kernel language-a simple core language that consists of a small number of programmer- significant elements. The kernel languages are introduced progressively, adding concepts one by one, thus showing the deep relationships between different models. The kernel languages are defined precisely in terms of a simple abstract machine. Because a wide variety of languages and programming paradigms can be modeled by a small set of closely related kernel languages, this approach allows programmer and student to grasp the underlying unity of programming. The book has many program fragments and exercises, all of which can be run on the Mozart Programming System, an Open Source software package that features an interactive incremental development environment.},

@inproceedings{Jr1990,
abstract = {We need a programming model that com- bines the advantages of the synchronous and asyn- chronous parallel styles. Synchronous programs are de- terminate (thus easier to reason about) and avoid syn- chronization overheads. Asynchronous programs are more flexible and handle conditionals more efficiently. Here we propose a programming model with the ben- efits of both styles. We allow asynchronous threads of control but restrict shared-memory accesses and other side effects so as to prevent the behavior of the program from depending on any accidents of execution order that can arise from the indeterminacy of the asynchronous process model. These restrictions may be enforced either dynam- ically (at run time) or statically (at compile time). In this paper we concentrate on dynamic enforcement, and exhibit an implementation of a parallel dialect of Scheme based on these ideas. A single successful exe- cution of a parallel program in this model constitutes a proof that the program is free of race conditions (for that particular set of input data). We also speculate on a design for a programming lan- guage using static enforcement. The notion of distinct- ness is important to proofs of noninterference. An ap- propriately designed programming language must sup port such concepts as “all the elements of this array are distinct,” perhaps through its type system. This parallel programming model does not support all styles of parallel programming, but we argue that it can support a large class of interesting algorithms with considerably greater efficiency (in some cases) than a strict SIMD approach and considerably greater safety (in all cases) than a full-blown MIMD approach.},

This turns out to be a principle with much broader utility than software project management, where references to it usually occur. I invite you to read the paper, then look around to find applications. My current favorite is the complex of social issues encompassing welfare, access to labor markets, housing, education, and drugs.

abstract = {Abstract The advent of multicore processors has renewed interest in the idea of incorporating transactions into the programming model used to write parallel programs. This approach, known as transactional memory, offers an alternative, and hopefully better, way to coordinate concurrent threads. The ACI (atomicity, consistency, isolation) properties of transactions provide a foundation to ensure that concurrent reads and writes of shared data do not produce inconsistent or incorrect results. At a higher level, a computation wrapped in a transaction executes atomically - either it completes successfully and commits its result in its entirety or it aborts. In addition, isolation ensures the transaction produces the same result as if no other transactions were executing concurrently. Although transactions are not a parallel programming panacea, they shift much of the burden of synchronizing and coordinating parallel computations from a programmer to a compiler, to a language runtime system, or to hardware.

abstract = {A wait-free implementation of a concurrent data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any operation in a finite number of steps, regardless of the execution speeds of the other processes. The problem of constructing a wait-free implementation of one data object from another lies at the heart of much recent work in concurrent algorithms, concurrent data structures, and multiprocessor architectures. First, we introduce a simple and general technique, based on reduction to a concensus protocol, for proving statements of the form, there is no wait-free implementation of X by Y. We derive a hierarchy of objects such that no object at one level has a wait-free implementation in terms of objects at lower levels. In particular, we show that atomic read/write registers, which have been the focus of much recent attention, are at the bottom of the hierarchy: thay cannot be used to construct wait-free implementations of many simple and familiar data types. Moreover, classical synchronization primitives such astest&set and fetch&add, while more powerful than read and write, are also computationally weak, as are the standard message-passing primitives. Second, nevertheless, we show that there do exist simple universal objects from which one can construct a wait-free implementation of any sequential object.},

abstract = {The paradigm shift in processor design from monolithic processors to multicore has renewed interest in programming models that facilitate parallelism. While multicores are here today, the future is likely to witness architectures that use reconfigurable fabrics (FPGAs) as coprocessors. FPGAs provide an unmatched ability to tailor their circuitry per application, leading to better performance at lower power. Unfortunately, the skills required to program FPGAs are beyond the expertise of skilled software programmers. This paper shows how to bridge the gap between programming software vs. hardware. We introduce Lime, a new Object-Oriented language that can be compiled for the JVM or into a synthesizable hardware description language. Lime extends Java with features that provide a way to carry OO concepts into efficient hardware. We detail an end-to-end system from the language down to hardware synthesis and demonstrate a Lime program running on both a conventional processor and in an FPGA.},

abstract = {Programswritten in powerful, higher-order languages like Scheme,ML, and CommonLisp should run as fast as their FORTRAN and C counterparts. They should, but they don’t. A major reason is the level of optimisation applied to these two classes of languages. Many FORTRAN and C compilers employ an arsenal of sophisticated global optimisations that depend upon data-flow analysis: common-subexpression elimination, loop-invariant detection, induction-variable elimination, and many, many more. Compilers for higher- order languages do not provide these optimisations. Without them, Scheme, LISP and ML compilers are doomed to produce code that runs slower than their FORTRAN and C counterparts. The problem is the lack of an explicit control-flow graph at compile time, somethingwhich traditional data-flow analysis techniques require. In this dissertation, I present a technique for recovering the control-flowgraph of aScheme programat compile time. I give examples of how this information can be used to perform several data-flow analysis optimisations, including copy propagation, induction-variable elimination, useless-variable elimination, and type recovery. The analysis is defined in termsof a non-standard semantic interpretation. The denotational semantics is carefully developed, and several theorems establishing the correctness of the semantics and the implementing algorithms are proven.},

abstract = {Various powerful polyhedral techniques exist to optimize computation intensive programs effectively. Applying these techniques on any non-trivial program is still surprisingly difficult and often not as effective as expected. Most polyhedral tools are limited to a specific programming language. Even for this language, relevant code needs to match specific syntax that rarely appears in existing code. It is therefore hard or even impossible to process existing programs automatically. In addition, most tools target C or OpenCL code, which prevents effective communication with compiler internal optimizers. As a result target architecture specific optimizations are either little effective or not approached at all. In this paper we present Polly, a project to enable polyhedral optimizations in LLVM. Polly automatically detects and transforms relevant programparts in a language-independent and syntactically transparent way. Therefore, it supports programs written in most common programming languages and constructs like C++ iterators, goto based loops and pointer arithmetic. Internally it provides a state-of-the-art polyhedral library with full support for Z-polyhedra, ad- vanced data dependency analysis and support for external optimizers. Polly includes integrated SIMD and OpenMP code generation. Through LLVM, machine code for CPUs and GPU accelerators, C source code and even hardware descriptions can be targeted.},

This adaptation amounts to solve an optimization problem in a huge and unstructured search space, while predicting the performance outcome of complex sequences of program transformations. The polyhedral model of compilation is aimed at these challenges. Its geometrical, non-inductive semantics enables the construction of better-structured optimization problems and precise analytical models. Recent work demonstrated the scalability of the main polyhedral algorithms to real-world programs. Its integration into production compilers is under way, pioneered by the Graphite branch of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

abstract = {The MPMD approach for parallel computing is attractive for programmers who seek fast development cycles, high code re-use, and modular programming, or whose applications exhibit irregular computation loads and communication patterns. RPC is widely adopted as the communication abstraction for crossing address space boundaries. However, the communication overheads of existing RPC-based systems are usually an order of magnitude higher than those found in highly tuned SPMD systems. This problem has thus far limited the appeal of high-level programming languages based on MPMD models in the parallel computing community. This paper investigates the fundamental limitations of MPMD communication using a case study of two parallel programming languages, Compositional C++ (CC++) and Split-C, that provide support for a global name space. To establish a common comparison basis, our implementation of CC++ was developed to use MRPC, a RPC system optimized for MPMD parallel computing and based on Active Messages. Basic RPC performance in CC++ is within a factor of two from those of Split-C and other messaging layers. CC++ applications perform within a factor of two to six from comparable Split-C versions, which represent an order of magnitude improvement over previous CC++ implementations. The results suggest that RPC-based communication can be used effectively in many high-performance MPMD parallel applications.},

Programs are constructed by using explicitly-declared communication channels to plug together program modules called processes. A process can encapsulate common data, subprocesses, and internal communication. (2) Safety. Operations on channels are restricted so as to guarantee deterministic execution, even in dynamic computations that create and delete processes and channels. Channels are typed, so a compiler can check for correct usage. (3) Architecture Independence. The mapping of processes to processors can be specified with respect to a virtual computer with size and shape different from that of the target computer. Mapping is specified by annotations that influence performance but not correctness. (4) Efficiency. Fortran M can be compiled efficiently for uniprocessors, sharedmemory computers, distributed-memory computers, and networks of workstations. Because message passing is incorporated into the language, a compiler can optimize communication as well as computation.},

We also explain how these mechanisms can be implemented in various environments. Our global pointer and remote service request mechanisms have been incorporated in a runtime system called Nexus that is used as a compiler target for parallel languages and as a substrate for higher-level communication libraries.

PVM supports a straightforward but functionally complete message passing model, and is capable of harnessing the combined resources of typically heterogeneous networked computing platforms to deliver high levels of performance and functionality. In this paper, we describe the architecture of PVM system, and discuss its computing model, the programming interface it supports, auxiliary facilities for process groups and MPP support, and some of the internal implementation techniques employed. Performance issues, dealing primarily with communication overheads, are analyzed, and recent findings as well as experimental enhancements are presented. In order to demonstrate the viability of PVM for large scale scientific supercomputing, the paper includes representative case studies in materials science, environmental science, and climate modeling. We conclude with a discussion of related projects and future directions, and comment on near and long-term potential for network computing with the PVM system.},

abstract = {There is a growing need for ad-hoc analysis of extremely large data sets, especially at internet companies where inno- vation critically depends on being able to analyze terabytes of data collected every day. Parallel database products, e.g., Teradata, offer a solution, but are usually prohibitively ex- pensive at this scale. Besides, many of the people who ana- lyze this data are entrenched procedural programmers, who find the declarative, SQL style to be unnatural. The success of the more procedural map-reduce programming model, and its associated scalable implementations on commodity hard- ware, is evidence of the above. However, the map-reduce paradigm is too low-level and rigid, and leads to a great deal of custom user code that is hard to maintain, and reuse. We describe a new language called Pig Latin that we have designed to fit in a sweet spot between the declarative style of SQL, and the low-level, procedural style of map-reduce. The accompanying system, Pig, is fully implemented, and compiles Pig Latin into physical plans that are executed over Hadoop, an open-source, map-reduce implementation. We give a few examples of how engineers at Yahoo! are using Pig to dramatically reduce the time required for the develop- ment and execution of their data analysis tasks, compared to using Hadoop directly. We also report on a novel debugging environment that comes integrated with Pig, that can lead to even higher productivity gains. Pig is an open-source, Apache-incubator project, and available for general use.},

@article{Chen2008,
abstract = {This paper describes a general and robust loop transformation framework that enables compilers to generate efficient code on complex loop nests. Despite two decades of prior research on loop optimization, performance of compiler-generated code often falls short of manually optimized versions, even for some well-studied BLAS kernels. There are two primary reasons for this. First, today’s compilers employ fixed transformation strategies, making it difficult to adapt to different optimization requirements for different application codes. Second, code transformations are treated in isolation, not taking into account the interactions between different transformations. This paper addresses such limitations in a unified framework that supports a broad collection of transformations, (permutation, tiling, unroll-and-jam, data copying, iteration space splitting, fusion, distribution and others), which go beyond existing polyhedral transformation models. This framework is a key element of a compiler we are developing which performs empirical op- timization to evaluate a collection of alternative optimized variants of a code segment. A script interface to code generation and empirical search permits transformation parameters to be adjusted independently and tested; alterna- tive scripts are used to represent different code variants. By applying this framework to example codes,we showperformance results on automatically- generated code for the PentiumM and MIPS R10000 that are comparable to the best hand-tuned codes, and significantly better (up to a 14x speedup) than the native compilers.},

@article{Catanzaro2009,
abstract = {Parallel programming must be accessible to domain experts without requiring them to become experts in parallel hardware architecture. While domain experts today prefer to use high-level “productivity” scripting languages with domain-appropriate abstractions, achieving high performance still requires expertise in lower-level “efficiency” lan- guages (CUDA, CILK, C with OpenMP) that expose hardware-level programming models directly. We bridge this gap through the use of embedded just-in-time specialization: domain experts write in high-level scripting languages, but at runtime, we specialize (generate, compile, and execute efficiency-language source code for) an application-specific and platform-specific subset of the productivity language. This enables invisible and selective optimization of only those application-level abstractions that enjoy a large performance advantage when expressed in an efficiency lan- guage on the available hardware and will be executed many times, amortizing the overhead of specialization. Because the specialization machinery is implemented in the productivity language, efficiency programmers can easily extend our system by adding new specializers for specific additional domain abstractions or new hardware, transparently to the productivity-language programmers. Our approach results in competitive performance on real applications with a fraction of the programming effort on the part of the domain expert. We argue that the separation of concerns enabled by embedded JIT specialization allows research to proceed in parallel on both the productivity and efficiency layers, and is therefore uniquely suited to the problem of making different parallel hardware architectures more accessible to domain-expert programmers with a fraction of the programmer time and effort.},

@article{Lee2013,
abstract = {Pipeline parallelism organizes a parallel program as a linear sequence of s stages. Each stage processes elements of a data stream, passing each processed data element to the next stage, and then taking on a new element before the subsequent stages have necessarily completed their processing. Pipeline parallelism is used especially in streaming applications that perform video, audio, and digital signal processing. Three out of 13 benchmarks in PARSEC, a popular software benchmark suite designed for shared-memory multiprocessors, can be expressed as pipeline parallelism. Whereas most concurrency platforms that support pipeline parallelism use a “construct-and-run” approach, this paper investigates “on-the-fly” pipeline parallelism, where the structure of the pipeline emerges as the program executes rather than being specified a priori. On-the-fly pipeline parallelism allows the number of stages to vary from iteration to iteration and dependencies to be data dependent. We propose simple linguistics for specifying on-the-fly pipeline parallelism and describe a provably efficient scheduling algorithm, the P IPER algorithm, which integrates pipeline parallelism into a work-stealing scheduler, allowing pipeline and fork-join parallelism to be arbitrarily nested. The PIPER algorithm automatically throttles the parallelism, precluding “runaway” pipelines. Given a pipeline computation with T_1 work and T_infty span (critical-path length), P IPER executes the computation on P processors in T P ≤ T 1 /P + O(T ∞ + lg P) expected time. PIPER also limits stack space, ensuring that it does not grow unboundedly with running time. We have incorporated on-the-fly pipeline parallelism into a Cilk-based work-stealing runtime system. Our prototype Cilk-P implementation exploits optimizations such as lazy enabling and dependency folding. We have ported the three PARSEC benchmarks that exhibit pipeline parallelism to run on Cilk-P. One of these, x264, cannot readily be executed by systems that support only construct-and-run pipeline parallelism. Benchmark results indicate that Cilk-P has low serial overhead and good scalability. On x264, for example, Cilk-P exhibits a speedup of 13.87 over its respective serial counterpart when running on 16 processors.},

abstract = {Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages are convenient for expressing algorithms with large, random-access data, and they have proven to provide high performance and scalability through lightweight one-sided communication and locality control. While very convenient for moving data around the system, PGAS languages have taken different views on the model of computation, with the static Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) model providing the best scalability. In this paper we present UPC++, a PGAS extension for C++ that has three main objectives: 1) to provide an object-oriented PGAS programming model in the context of the popular C++ language, 2) to add useful parallel programming idioms unavailable in UPC, such as asynchronous remote function invocation and multidimensional arrays, to support complex scientific applications, 3) to offer an easy on-ramp to PGAS programming through interoperability with other existing parallel programming systems (e.g., MPI, OpenMP, CUDA). We implement UPC++ with a "compiler-free" approach using C++ templates and runtime libraries. We borrow heavily from previous PGAS languages and describe the design decisions that led to this particular set of language features, providing significantly more expressiveness than UPC with very similar performance characteristics. We evaluate the programmability and performance of UPC++ using five benchmarks on two representative supercomputers, demonstrating that UPC++ can deliver excellent performance at large scale up to 32K cores while offering PGAS productivity features to C++ applications.},

@article{Asanovic2006,
abstract = {The recent switch to parallel microprocessors is a milestone in the history of computing. Industry has laid out a roadmap for multicore designs that preserves the programming paradigm of the past via binary compatibility and cache coherence. Conventional wisdom is now to double the number of cores on a chip with each silicon generation. A multidisciplinary group of Berkeley researchers met nearly two years to discuss this change. Our view is that this evolutionary approach to parallel hardware and software may work from 2 or 8 processor systems, but is likely to face diminishing returns as 16 and 32 processor systems are realized, just as returns fell with greater instruction-level parallelism. We believe that much can be learned by examining the success of parallelism at the extremes of the computing spectrum, namely embedded computing and high performance computing. This led us to frame the parallel landscape with seven questions, and to recommend the following: The overarching goal should be to make it easy to write programs that execute efficiently on highly parallel computing systems The target should be 1000s of cores per chip, as these chips are built from processing elements that are the most efficient in MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) per watt, MIPS per area of silicon, and MIPS per development dollar. Instead of traditional benchmarks, use 13 "Dwarfs" to design and evaluate parallel programming models and architectures. (A dwarf is an algorithmic method that captures a pattern of computation and communication.) "Autotuners" should play a larger role than conventional compilers in translating parallel programs. To maximize programmer productivity, future programming models must be more human-centric than the conventional focus on hardware or applications. To be successful, programming models should be independent of the number of processors. To maximize application efficiency, programming models should support a wide range of data types and successful models of parallelism: task-level parallelism, word-level parallelism, and bit-level parallelism. Architects should not include features that significantly affect performance or energy if programmers cannot accurately measure their impact via performance counters and energy counters. Traditional operating systems will be deconstructed and operating system functionality will be orchestrated using libraries and virtual machines. To explore the design space rapidly, use system emulators based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) that are highly scalable and low cost. Since real world applications are naturally parallel and hardware is naturally parallel, what we need is a programming model, system software, and a supporting architecture that are naturally parallel. Researchers have the rare opportunity to re-invent these cornerstones of computing, provided they simplify the efficient programming of highly parallel systems.},

abstract = {Dynamic code generation allows aggressive optimization through the use of runtime information. Previous systems typically relied on ad hoc code generators that were not designed for retargetability, and did not shield the client from machine-specific details. We present a system, dcg, that allows clients to specify dynamically generated code in a machine-independent manner. Our one-pass code generator is easily retargeted and extremely efficient (code generation costs approximately 350 instructions per generated instruction). Experiments show that dynamic code generation increases some application speeds by over an order of magnitude.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is an emerging concept combining many fields of computing. The foundation of cloud computing is the delivery of services, software and processing capacity over the Internet, reducing cost, increasing storage, automating systems, decoupling of service delivery from underlying technology, and providing flexibility and mobility of information. However, the actual realization of these benefits is far from being achieved for mobile applications and open many new research questions. In order to better understand how to facilitate the building of mobile cloud-based applications, we have surveyed existing work in mobile computing through the prism of cloud computing principles. We give a definition of mobile cloud coputing and provide an overview of the results from this review, in particular, models of mobile cloud applications. We also highlight research challenges in the area of mobile cloud computing. We conclude with recommendations for how this better understanding of mobile cloud computing can help building more powerful mobile applications.},
