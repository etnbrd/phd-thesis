abstract = {The Ninja project seeks to enable the broad innovation of robust, scalable, distributed Internet services, and to permit the emerging class of extremely heterogeneous devices to seamlessly access these services. Our architecture consists of four basic elements: bases, which are powerful workstation cluster environments with a software platform that simplifies scalable service construction; units, which are the devices by which users access the services; active proxies, which are transformational elements that are used for unit- or service-specific adaptation; and paths, which are an abstraction through which units, services, and active proxies are composed.},

@article{Holtman2008,
abstract = {The universal scalability law (USL) is an analytic model used to quantify application scaling. It is universal because it subsumes Amdahl's law and Gustafson linearized scaling as special cases. Using simulation, we show: (i) that the USL is equivalent to synchronous queueing in a load-dependent machine repairman model and (ii) how USL, Amdahl's law, and Gustafson scaling can be regarded as boundaries defining three scalability zones. Typical throughput measurements lie across all three zones. Simulation scenarios provide deeper insight into queueing effects and thus provide a clearer indication of which application features should be tuned to get into the optimal performance zone.},

abstract = {The universal scalability law of computational capacity is a rational function C{\_}p = P(p)/Q(p) with P(p) a linear polynomial and Q(p) a second-degree polynomial in the number of physical processors p, that has been long used for statistical modeling and prediction of computer system performance. We prove that C{\_}p is equivalent to the synchronous throughput bound for a machine-repairman with state-dependent service rate. Simpler rational functions, such as Amdahl's law and Gustafson speedup, are corollaries of this queue-theoretic bound. C{\_}p is further shown to be both necessary and sufficient for modeling all practical characteristics of computational scalability.},

@inproceedings{Choudhury2011,
abstract = {The Universal Scalability Law (USL) of computational capacity has been proposed by Neil J. Gunther. USL abstracts the coefficients of inter process interactions and other contentions in the area of parallel and distributed computing in a set of constant parameters {\{}$\sigma$, $\lambda${\}}. One cannot apply USL for the purpose of predicting performance, unless the values of those constant parameters are known. A computationally light weight and theoretically correct algorithm to estimate those parameters from measured performance data is not available yet. Simple linear-regression or standard least-square-error-approximation is a widely used efficient statistical technique to estimate parameters. A simple linear-regression cannot be applied directly to estimate the coefficients $\sigma$, $\lambda$ of USL, because USL is a rational function. In this work, we propose a novel and elegant algorithm based on standard least-square-error-approximation or linear-regression to estimate the parameters. The explanation of failure of simple linear-regression is discussed by visiting the basic theory of linear-regression. A novel approach, consisting of algebraic manipulations to transform the problem into two linear-regression problems, is presented. The linear-regression is applied successively in a certain order to estimate the constant parameters, $\sigma$, $\lambda$, of USL. The proposed technique is applied to a set of measured performance data to validate and verify the proposed technique.},
